I have always been pretty useless socially, but have had a normal upbringing, no horrible experiences, have gone through education fine and even got jobs but I've never enjoyed life, never really cared and normally feel like I'm not really worth anything	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

I'm not going to be dramatic and say I'm going to end it, it sounds so pathetic (no offence intended to anyone) but I have thoughts of 'going' or even dreams that I could die 'blamelessly' thorugh accident or illness.

I have a cycle. Get job, put on confident easy going persona, get physically tired from doing that, lose energy to maintain job, focus on negative, leave job in some form (fired/quit). Friends are much the same, play easy going fun, can't keep it up, lose or push them away. Relationships, get attracted to ones who need help, help them in anyway I can, get to a point where I feel I am no more use so should go as they'd be ultimately better off.	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667	
So, currently I've quit my job as a teacher, couldn't take it - always something to improve and with my way of thinking that just sounds like constantly someone telling you you're useless (and it backing up your own thoughts anyway) but even though I liked aspects of my job I don't think I had a passion like I see in others. I felt I'd let everyone down so disappeared, my partner/ parents got me through immediate days after my sudden departure from work and saw Doc who was nice enough - put me on medication which seemed to do very little - even after a few months. In fact it only had negative side effects so about three weeks ago I stopped taking them completely. I also started seeing a CBT person about three/four session ago but this feels like it's doing nothing at all either, we talk, I'm honest as I can be but there is some element of being 'public' and putting on that face/ jokey responses.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I dip between a wish to not be around that is forever there and seems to be backed up with wholly logical reasons that people genuinely struggle to refute to absolutely crashing panic attacks/ given up when my 'theories' are proved.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
I know this sounds odd, but I don't even have the will to get 'better', largely because I don't think I can. I am just 'me'. I am negative, boring and even if it is all just selffullfillng profecies - it's still me who has done that. I'm not blaming life, or others or anything else.	2	4	4	3.333333333	1.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667					3.333333333

I just feel I'm never going to be happy, I am soon to be much a burden on those around me (my gf) and that, in the long run, it'd be better for all if I just went. I know my family and gf love me - but time heals, life would get better and people move on. In the long run I'm sure it wouldn't effect my family and 100% sure my gf would be better off.	4	2	4	3.333333333	0.6666666667	1.333333333	0.6666666667					3.333333333

"You have taken the first step and that is asking for help. It can always be worse. It sounds like you are extremely depressed. I too have had problems keeping jobs and friends.. when I got to the point to where I wanted to end my life, I did something that I've always wanted to do. I went skydiving and all my big problems became very small. I think facing death in an indirect way helped turn my life around. Every time I got to the point to where I was depressed I would go skydiving again. About seven years ago I didn't think it to get worse but I got Dystonia torticollis, that's where your muscles start pulling the wrong way. My head lies on my shoulder and I'm in extreme pain all the time. In between being depressed and getting torticollis I actually became successful until I got torticollis. Please try skydiving jumping out of a plane will help. And remember it can always get worse. If you realize how lucky you are and that ""the big problems in life are really not as big as what you think"" I am now broke and I'm worse off than I've ever been but I feel everyday is a gift. Even though I'm in extreme pain and my body is distorted now for some reason I want to live every minute that I possibly can. Just remember it could always be worse.

"What a fantastic answer, but also a really bad one!! Let me explain...	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​Firstly I'm very pleased to see you are happy and treat every day as a gift. Obviously I'm sorry you have such daily physical problems but I'm sure that makes you even happier you did the skydiving when you did. I'm really pleased what you did worked for you and it's encouraging to find a rare example of someone who has somewhat defeated depression even if the cost of that has been quite extreme.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​But then on the same hand, not recognising how lucky I am isn't the problem, it's knowing that I am and I'm still not feeling good which then further compounds how bad I feel about myself. I know I'm luckier than most, I know things could be worse, I live in an affluent country with water on tap, have good health and had a normal upbringing with no major traumas. So knowing this makes me feel EVEN worse about myself. I see I'm selfish, and ungrateful, and petty and all other words - why can't I just be happy?	3	4	3	3.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					3.333333333	
​I've put my life on the line a few times, both within the safety confines of organised activities and on the less controlled activities I may do myself - it doesn't help me. Being near death doesn't impact me positively or negatively - I'm almost apathetic to it.	3	3	1	2.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667	1.333333333					2.333333333	
​And this is why your answer is both fantastic and bad! For you, and others it may work. You are obviously an inspiration to lots of people not only for the physical issues (which are almost a separate issue) but for the fact you have altered your way of thinking in a positive manner. But they also highlight how everyone's issues are unique - and as well intentioned, and even correct, your view that it could be worse it, that can actually make people feel worse.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​If we all focused on 'it could be worse' they'd be very few people in this world who could complain, unfortunately it's not that simple. This depression doesn't care that I'm lucky, it just cares that I think badly of myelf and reminds me of it every day and actually accelerates when I speak to people who could argue they do have a good reason to feel bad. I know I don't - and that makes it even worse.	5	4	5	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					4.666666667

rsjg, you apparently have some free time on your hands during the days while the bread winner in your team is at work for you. You also sound as though you like to help people and don't currently have any excuse not to try something simple for someone else's benifit.

​I wish I could talk to you more directly than on an open forum. I've said before, knowledge is a great thing - but it can also be a curse. You need to be particuarly careful self-diagnosing but also need to think whether this diagnosis is in any way helpful to you. Say you decide that you are HFAS - how does that help you? If you can't source help then it is just another meaningless semantic for feeling awful day to day.	0	3	0	1	1	2	1		INVALID		0	0	
​I've also mentioned that it is probably important to get outside your own head - think about doing things that stop you thinking about yourself. However, as a caveat, I also recognise doing anything (like talking to another human being as you rightly point out!) can be extrememly stressful.	1	3	0	1.333333333	0.3333333333	1.666666667	1.333333333					1.333333333

​To be honest, knowledge is something I despise yet am addicted to so I will inevitably be searching HFSA after I've written this reply! But without an argument or focus it is impossible to really research a topic to any purpose. I will happily help others if I can (preferably from afar!) but not sure what I could do to focus your research on this matter and whether it'd even be of any benefit to you anyway.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333

​As I'm sure you're aware, everyone is somewhere on the autistic spectrum and all the various labels that spin off that. Even the most 'normal' of people might feel particuarly calmed by a colour, or get irritated by a simple tapping noise. The issues arise when your 'quirks' impact on your life.

​I have had a ton of labels I have both researched or been told about that might fit my ways of thinking and acting but the conclusion I reached was that it was all kind of pointless - a label by its very nature is just a broad title to fit many people and when that comes to the brain it's a very pointless exercise. You might be able to group broken limbs in patients but with the head it's nearly impossible - there's too many bits that do or don't apply for every individual. Ultimately a title is only helpful to point you in the right direction to get you personalised help. And it HAS to be personalised.	3	3	1	2.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667	1.333333333					2.333333333	
​I think I have depression, with social anxiety. I have signs of bipolar, I get symptoms of SAD, I have trichotillomania, I have mild OCD that gets worse if I'm stressed, I have panic attacks, I over think everything, I have low self-esteem and no confidence, I feel suicidal most days and a million other mini-labels. Doesn't help me though. It's the classic 'what's in a name?'	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Let's be honest, there is more bad in this world than there is good. Consciously or not, we're all constantly being barraged with negative messages. And negative emotions have more staying power than fleeting feelings of joy. Your brain is more than likely over stimulated and is compensating / protecting you by dulling your emotions.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Like shock, depression is a manifestation of our brain's self-protecting powers. It's by no means a comfortable state of being, it leaves one feeling 'flat' (to depress is to flatten), apathetic, tired. But it's an effective mechanism that shields us from feeling intense upset.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
What you are describing rsjg, is typical depression. I think that you will find that you will cycle in and out of it throughout your lifetime. This is not a character weakness, as you come off as being very honest, insightful, caring, and intelligent.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I haven't lived in Brittain (I'm assuming that's where you're from) but here in the U.S. there is tremendous (and unrealistic) pressure to be happy all the time. Nobody can live up to that standard, and 'phonying up' (so others will be more comfortable around you) and living with self - deception is exhausting. If that doesn't rob one of a strong sense of self, depression surely will. The best that we should aim for is contentment.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I apologise if I jumped to conclusions based on your message but I maintain that with the active social life you live you have LOADS of people who would miss you.

"Thats emotional flatness and it is depression. You sound like you've got a lot going for you, plenty of work experience, a girlfriend. I get that you can't enjoy anything, maybe talk to your doctor about getting another prescription? Sometimes certain medications work better than others. Regular exercise is good eg running. Happiness is a concept which is chosen. Try to see the brilliant person that you are and how much you've already done. See you feeling discontent with your occupation as a chance to do something about it. Think about what sort of job you'd really want to do.

However, you're right, there is an element of fanning the flames! The reason I've largely stopped looking at this site is I don't see a benefit for me or anyone else.

People say knowledge is power, but I find it to be a curse. The more you know, the more you realise your insignificance, the hopelessness of situations and the reality of the world rather than the rose-tinted 'it'll all work out in the end' view we're told to believe. I really struggle with the inability of professionals to accept that some people don't succeed, some people do fail, some people aren't talented, some people aren't nice - why can't that be me? It's no different than saying ""it can't happen to me"".	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
So for that reason I'm very much keeping this site at arms length.

Little has changed. I tried drugs, didn't work, I tried therapy, too much religion and not willing to try again - a weird catch 22 in where you need to ask for help but are afraid of talking to people even day to day. Friends are nonexistent, I quit my job and haven't returned. I still feel like a burden to those around me, and how ever much they care it doesn't excuse it - in fact it makes it worse. I can't escape feeling that if I was a good person then I'd protect them from me - if you were highly infectious with a deadly disease would you hug your family?

"Well your family and girlfriend would never get over it, from what I've read. Plus it can go wrong and be messy. It sounds like you thinking you are 'boring' is your take on things. You don't have to feel sad to be depressed, some feel nothing at all. I think it would be a shame to see you go. To me it sounds like you have plenty to be grateful for, a girlfriend, a family who loves you. Personally I recommend that you try yoga classes-I'm aware this sounds insane, but entertain the idea a second/bare with me. I suffer from OCD/depression/anxiety. Ever since I started doing yoga things got better for me-it helped me relax/exercise. You could spin this around and start thinking you have nothing to lose. As for the antidepressants I recommend you start exercising regularly-cardiovascular and weights. Similar effect, no side effects. Try setting yourself a regime Running in the morning, weights afternoon. Listen to music whilst doing so. You can beat this, trust me.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

"I really think you should try the medication route again. There are so many different types and combinations of antidepressants out there. I personally take 20mg of Paroxetine once a day and 50mg of Quetiapine before bed each night. It's only been a month but I really think it is helping me as well as chatting with people on this forum. I quit a good job of thirteen years last year because of anxiety, then spent the next six months sitting on the couch self-medicating on painkillers. Never to the extent that I was high, but just to feel normal. I had to kick my own arse into gear because I'm the sole carer of a special needs child and no-one else was there to step in to do the job. Everyday when I get up I still have to re-affirm my dreams and goals and why it so important that I get better. Almost like a daily mantra. One of my goals is to finish a novel I started before I got ill three years ago. But instead of just sitting down in front of the computer and writing, which really is not much of a motivation, I've joined an online writer's group and am in the process of doing up one of the spare rooms into a study. A place that belongs to me only where I can display all my favourite things (incuding my Star Wars collectibles) and where I can go to escape from the world. I guess I can say I do have genuine reasons for my anxiety and depression, including financial, health and the fact that my daughter is considered severely disabled (she has Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, one of only 500 in the world), but everyday I pick my daughter up from the special school she attends I am always reminded life could be far worse. You don't truly appeciate how lucky you are until you've walked though a special school full of wheelchair bound kiddies with feeding chubes in their little bellies. Since my daughter has attended that school at least three children have passed away because of the complications associated with their disabilities. My daughter may not be able to talk and I have to attend all her self-care needs even though she is nine years of age (and probably will for the rest of her life) but at least she is healthy and robust.

As regards the drug route, a lot of people have suggested this. However one major issue stops me and is not really ever talked about - I'm terrified of people/meetings etc! So I can't see a Doctor! When at my lowest I was being ferried around so had no choice and needed a Doctors note etc but now the thought of seeing a Doctor (or any body I know I have to talk to) terrifies me to the point I'd almost have a panic attack.

Did you have anxiety before all the pressures you're under? I think you'd feel a hell of a lot better quicker if you directed your energy to finding financial and/or respite support if there is any. You're probably doing too much and it's impacting on your health physically and emotionally. If there isn't any further help then, other than shaking your head at the hand you've been dealt, then you seem to have a good plan of action at the moment. If that plan could be super organised to include you (as in time for yourself etc) and maybe incorporate a job (if you so wished) you may find you were in control a bit more.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I'm not trying to sound dismissive at all I promise! You have a compelling reason to feel the way you do and I acknowledge I'm talking without all the facts. I just get the sense it's a lack of control on a very hectic/ emotional draining life that is you're primary concern. For example, if you won the lottery and could deal with all the bills and give the care to your daughter you wish do you think you'd feel infinitely better? You're depressed because of the situation I think so hopefully either you, or you and others, could plan a route that would help you considerably. I think there is a lot of hope for you to be VERY happy and enjoy your life with your daughter but you've just been struggling for years and it's worn you down. Asking for help (other than medicinal) is the right way to go.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I think my girlfriend might stay with someone she felt sorry for, like a responsibility for so to speak. I think she WOULD be sad if I 'left' but she'd be happy again a lot sooner than having to live with me! It's quite analytical, I recognise that, but to me I'd rather her be sad for a year with 'loss' rather than sad for 20 years with me! It's weighing up value, short term pain for long term gain... As for a job, my head stops me, I feel I can do most jobs but only temporarily as my head messes me up, messes my professional relationships up and I just can't see how I can hold down a job - it's hard to explain, but being sociable (like you have to be at work) is almost physically draining and eventually my energy runs out and I drop all the balls I'm juggling.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

Ordinary to me is depressing. Ordinary is forgetable, ordinary is boring, ordinary doesn't 'exist'.

My daughter has value to me, she saved me from my depression and has made me a better person. EVERYONE HAS VALUE. Please see this and please try to get some help.

The final comment I will make is that to me, if you went and saw the GP - maybe bring a long your girlfriend or somebody who makes you feel a bit more at ease, don't see a male GP, personally I never do. My own GP told me that female doctors are usually a lot more compassionate, regardless. Sort out your anxiety, that's the main thing that's holding you back, yes a drug that may work wonders for one person may not make a difference to you and no, they are not a magic fix and won't make everything better in a few weeks - it's trial and error and it takes a very long time.

The girlfriend question comment is a difficult one and the one I battle every day more than anything else. If I leave her there is nowhere to go, that really is it.

I stay through her appeals and for maybe that ounce of hope that she, and others, are right that it'll pass. Although I've always been like this. I'm not staying with her for ease, or to string her along, but leaving her really is a final decision - I have no belief there is something better than her. Probably makes no sense.

If I can't prepare, i.e. I know there will be questions I'm not expecting or it's someone I feel who will judge me e.g. a car mechanic as a 'guy' then I can't do it. How silly is this - I still get uneasy surrounded by teenage girls! I'm not in the remotest bit interested in them obviously, but just the feeling of inadequacy/ that I'm a loser makes me feel 'weird'. Same with family, there is a duration before it gets too personal; I can feel myself being overly happy and lively around them as if it's all pouring out on first meeting them but that there is a finite amount and then my energy drops and I disappear.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

First of all, I just want to say that yes, you do have depression. I'm pretty sure you've confirmed that with yourself by now, but the symptom you seem to mostly express of depression is apathy. You're apathetic--you don't care, and sometimes, it scares you and confuses you and frustrates you as to why you don't care. Why don't you care? How does it make sense to just not care about life, whenever everyone around you seems to always care?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Or maybe I have it totally wrong, and that's not what you think, but I'll answer those questions to the best of my abilities anyway. Apathy is part of depression, and depression can be caused by many things. I for one know it is genetic--my dad had it, my paternal grandmother had it, and I don't know farther back than that but I'm fairly certain it's because of that. So it could be that you're the same and your depression is genetic, which in that case you should ask family members about it, or that it's caused by your lack of satisfaction with what you have and what you are doing. You don't feel fulfilled, and you don't feel passionate about anything.	5	5	0	3.333333333	1.666666667	1.666666667	3.333333333			INVALID	4	4	
You should find something, then. I know that sounds ridiculous, and hard, and ridiculously hard. Try music, sketching, singing, swimming, writing, ice-skating, dancing, whatever--as long as it's enjoyable, it's helpful. It's just a hobby. It's not for you to feel bad about yourself that you can't do any of those or you suck at those because who the hell cares? It's just something you like to do. As long as you can find something like that, then it's one step out of the deep dark pit you've dug yourself into.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Another thing is to talk to people. Your girlfriend, for instance, could be one person to start with, or maybe you have a really close friend you would prefer talking to. Whoever you think you can trust the most, who you think will listen the most, believe you the most, talk to them. Don't feel like you're being a burden on them because seriously, they want to help someone they love. They love you, goddamn it, and don't forget that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Since my depression is genetic, it's been following me around for a while. It's always hung around me, but in the past couple of months it hit me again and I was struggling for the longest time, trying to fight it off and trying to keep up a happy disposition around friends at school but always in the end feeling terrible and useless. And finally I decided I had to talk to someone. I talked to my sister. It was over the course of several talking sessions with her that I learned something: she really, truly cared. I mean--she really, really did. It wasn't that she hugged me and I cried in front of her and it was some disgustingly sweet sh*t, but it was that she listened and when I implied that yeah, lately, I've had suicidal thoughts...	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Well, she said, ""If you actually, like, took your life, I don't know--I would feel really terrible. Like, I would be really sad. I might commit suicide, too.""	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
And she is not a suicidal person in any aspect. It just told me that she would be deeply affected by my death and she wanted me around; she thought I was interesting and one of her closest companions and she still does, of course.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Hm, I think I'm getting off-topic. You may or may not have someone like that in your life, but you don't know unless you talk to them. Even if you don't, it's out there--you talked to them, and connected with other human beings, and as humans, we crave human contact--even the most reclusive of us. I know I sometimes just need to be alone, but I still need my ""fix"" of social interaction to feel not-lonely.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
Now, you mentioned feeling anxious about talking to your doctor about getting more meds. Social anxiety right there. You can search up the definition if you'd like to find several different definitions and examples and stuff that you could relate to and find more information about. However, it's basically that you overanalyze social situations you're in and criticize yourself about your own reactions and actions before, during, and after a certain social interaction, and everything that you did was oh-so-stupid. You're upset about it, of course. You're embarrassed.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
The thing is, however, is that you're likely not going to see them again. You think it's embarrassing to tell them about your depression, but keep in mind that there's plenty of people like us out there and plenty of people have gone to doctors to get meds for their depression. Your doctor may have seen PLENTY of people who have depression. It's a serious problem that needs treatment--don't imagine that just because it's not a physical illness or injury that it's not as important. It IS important.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
And if you think you embarrass yourself while visiting the doctor, so what? You talk to them, make a fool out of yourself, but you get your medication. And...you think about it afterwards, and realize, hey, nothing actually happened to you. You're still fine after that one interaction. They're not going to spend all day thinking about you and your apparent making-a-fool-out-of-yourself, so you don't need to either. What could help, I'm not sure, is think about him/her and not yourself. Observe them, and notice any flaws about them, and feel like you're in power of the situation because you're better than them.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I probably do have depression, I acknowledge that. I think my personality might not help but I agree, depression is likely. I have social anxiety, I over think far too much, I have mild symptoms of OCD, I have some body issues, I hide my trichotillomania well being male (face) and I'm somewhat of a perfectionist or idealist - if I could have done it better then it was crap.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Genetically speaking there doesn't seem to be any history of it in my family. Because of the way my last job blew up, my parents became more aware of the situation. That's not to say they were completely blind to it, but it became more of a discussion. My parents have both had depression due to work but were fine before and after the event that caused it (tribunals etc) but they don't really understand the 'lack of reason' side of it. I shared with them for a while, on both ups and downs, but got the impression it was upsetting them so have largely stopped talking about it. I never mentioned suicide to them. Again, due to the situation my older sister became aware and she too pressed a little but there is a limit you want to talk about things when all it does is upset people and they can't help you anyway. I have not talked about it with other family members. I'm already known as the depressing one, so I try to sound super happy when I'm around family now. I was told that the reason I'm, at least subconciously, left out in family gatherings is because I'm quiet/ serious/ boring (actual terms!). I'm aware they'd care if I wasn't here - most people are genetically programmed to protect their kin, but my absence would make no difference really. I now spend Xmas away from family, I'm fairly sure they're happier for it! I hate being a chore. I love your statement about it being 'disgusting sweet s*t' - that's so very much my style, even in the depths it's very much black humour, sarcasm etc - struggle with sweet stuff!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Outside my family there is just my girlfriend. That sounds extreme, but it's really not. I don't have a single other friend, that is equally my fault. But I talk to no one from University days, no ex colleagues etc. I know no-one else. Partially I like it that way, it's easy and I don't feel like a burden, on the other hand I feel like some of them could have fought to 'look after me' - they all gave up very easily. I know that's not fair. You shouldn't test your friends. But on the other hand, if I really cared for someone and knew they were struggling emotionally, I'd put in a little more effort. I wasn't ever mean or snappy with them, I just kind of disappeared. But it's not their job to understand mental issues, they have their own busy lives with their own problems.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
So I sometimes speak to my girlfriend, less so these days though. When it all hit the fan I had no choice but to share everything with her, not that it was brand new information of anything - I've been with her for a long time. But maybe the intensity of the feelings was new, of the fact they were always there. But again, there's very little she can do so why depress her. I don't want to see her cry because of me. So I've largely stopped talking about things, in a way that might give her the impression I'm improving. Occasionally stuff slips out, or I sarcastically mention 'leaving' but I cover it well now. I still tell her to find someone else, I cover it in a light/jokey way but, although I'm not stupid and I know she sees though it, it is kind of an acceptable level of sharing.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
You're right about social anxiety too. That I fully recognise. I care way more than I should, or want to, about others thoughts. Doesn't stop it though. I do analyse everything I've said and done before and after events but I can't forget it - really stupid example; I still remember saying something that was taken the mick out of at school, probably really mildly, and that was about twenty five years ago! How the hell can I get over this when I still stew over stuff I said when I was 9?!	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
Despite seeing every flaw in myself I don't take criticism well, not in a grumpy way but in a defeatest way. If I'm told a million things are good but 'this' needs improving then it was an awful experience. I know that is both ridiculous and common but want it stop effecting me so much. In complete contrast I am very patient and forgiving of others, I'll always see the other side of the argument and I'll happily give people as much time as they need. I'm the epitomy of 'do as I say, not as I do!'. I know where I'm going wrong, I know my thought processes are messed up, but I just don't know how to fix them. I can't think of many situations where I've felt 'better' than anyone else - the closest I get it wondering why horrible people in this world are more likely to succeed; stupidity is rewarded (TOWIE type), rudeness is applauded (Cowell), stabbing people in the back is relabled 'ambition', and generous people get walked on and criminals win the lottery!	2	2	3	2.333333333	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					2.333333333	
I'm really happy you've started to figure your life out. You sound very intelligent and in control. You also mentioned being in school so I suspect you are quite young; for you to have such a good grip on your feelings and recognise triggers and mental health issues is quite impressive. Is it an avenue you have interest in? I'm genuinely happy you have got such a grip on it early, understanding it early may help you in the long run - I don't know, but I suspect the longer this is left the harder it is to undo the 'learning to hate yourself' that is embedded in to you. Much like whe I used to teach, the longer you left a mistake/misconception with a child the harder it was to 'unteach' it - so I just have 34 years to unteach myself!	2	1	1	1.333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					1.333333333

"Thank you So much for the reply rsjg. Here it goes.. My problem is something too irrigative even myself. I am unmarried and i am 26 years old. I was in relationship with a guy more than 5 years.. We broke up many times and compromised too many times. It’s all just bcz I have bad habit of not hurting anyone. Whatever he does I used to excuse him. However he was kinda guy with negative/inferiority complex. He always used to think that I ll cheat him even though I did lot many sacrifices for him and waited for 5 years. He always used to imagine that I have other affairs even if I say 100 times dont think negative. His words tortured me like hell. I Started to doubt myself by listening same kinda blamings from him every time. Finally decided to come out from that relationship. I said OK to my parents for their process of searching guys for me. But my mind set is not allowing me to say OK to any of the guys they show. I get too many questions and I find too many faults in everyone. Even sometimes I feel like why do I get marry and spoil that guy's life? Sometimes I feel I dont want marriage and run away from all. Whole village started to talk wrong about me. I do even started to doubt myself. Am I mental?	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
I dont even mingle too much with freinds these days. There is a reason for that. I dont mingle too much with female friends, coz I feel that girls always have jealous and always two girls cant be friends for so long coz possessiveness is the big chalenge in girls. And I have the real experience with my so called female friends. I am fine to mingle with guys from my childhood. But whichever guy becomes my friend, I treat him as my Good friend. But for them/him always friendship with girl-means a different thing. I dont understand why all guys sexually attract towards me even if i dont expect it from them. I doubt myself that do I look like prostitute? I dont think so... But If I intrupt and ask about marriage with the same guy he of- course rejects me. Whats wrong with me. Why the whole world is like this? I feel tortured when I think about this kinda behavior from my so called friends. So I stopped to talking any friends.. Neither girls.. nor guys... Bcs of all these confusions I am not even satisfied with my professional life. Feeling too much stressed. I started to stay alone now. But staying alone suppressed me completely. I feel like I lost meaning for life. I dont understand why am I alive. Why should we lead life just to earn. why should we lead the life to struggle like this. If someone suggests me to go enjoy the life by partying or travelling, then I feel like why do we need to enjoy life when there is no use to anyone? Just to lead the life I need to live? There must be a reason or meaning for our life, else living like hopeless is of no use. I hate myself. I feel like I am burden for my parents. I cant even die when they are alive. I cant hurt them. I cant even live the life like this. Feeling frustrated on my own behavior.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

I am 34 and unmarried but I get the feeling this is a cultural issue for you? You say you feel you need to be married, yet I know no-one who married before 30 and a majority of those were much later. Do you WANT to be married? There really is no rush.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
As to your ex, you have shown great strength to leave someone you felt wasn't treating you well or was making you think badly of yourself. I am not going to slate him as I'm sure he has his own side of the story. But you were together five years which shows you have no issues with commitment either. Both of these show some strength but, again, being single is not a bad thing. Be single for as long as you want or until you find the right person.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I keep coming back to the feeling there is a cultural reason for you wanting to be married/ with someone? That is very difficult for me to advise. However, maybe moving away of that is possible to be your own person and npt live the life others expect you to? If it's possible of course. I know we all like to think of life as being poilte but some people simply can not accept others ways of thinking so it is sometimes better to just move to where you are accepted for who you are, whether that be single, old, young, gay or 'weird'! The fight normally isn't worth it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
As for your relationships with guys then, again, it's hard to put a finger on the 'issue'. In fact a lot of issues are not gender specific - you can't help who you find attractive. I have seen plenty of women who I think are stunning, but some are horrible people! I also can't force myself to find attractive someone I don't just because they are a lovely person. If you are very attractive then you should only take it as a compliment. You will never stop people finding you attractive or not, it's uncontrollable. You dress how you want, you act how you want and then people can decide whether they find the outside of you attractive, you just be you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
You also seem to be relatively passive in your selection of potential partners, they don't just have to chose you, you have to chose them too. What are you looking for in a partner? I have only ever ended up dating girls I have been friends with for quite a time beore it ever turned romantic and that seems to be a good way to realy get to know someone. Especially if you're female and they only really after one thing! Again, if it's cultural it's different, but I don't understand the urge to speak about marriage so soon - I'll be honest, if any woman spoke to me about marriage after a few months I'd be running a mile!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
As for men being friends with women and vice-versa, if there is an attraction there then it's hard not to want more - not just men. But I do believe it is possible to be friends with the opposite sex without there ever being anything else. However, if you find someone attractive and get on with them really well of course they are going to want to make it something more as what's missing?! You again should take it as a compliment that men seem to find you attractive and interesting! If you don't reciprocate their feelings and they can't handle it then that's their issue. I've been friends with women who I've quite 'liked' but haven't felt the same towards me so I accept it and remained good friends with them.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
So in summary it's hard to answer you. If I could suggest one thing without offence, it'd be to think what YOU want. You need to be selfish for a bit - what do you want from life, what do you want in a partner, do you want to be single for a bit? Ignore parents, ignore society, ignore expectations. At least then you can find a path to where you want to be - you're never going to please everyone so the easiest thing to do first is please yourself. You're 26, you're not old, you give the impression you're at least attractive and interesting to those you meet and have friends and family who look after you, you are in no rush but just decide what YOU want.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Your job seems a big source of your feelings too. It is my belief that society makes us all believe we're supposed to love our jobs and this can lead to discontentment.

I have experienced loss. But I know that time fixes everything, life moves on whether you want it to or not. It's a poor example but it's most accurate I can give you that is based on real, not academic, events. My grandparent had a horrible disease that was progressively worse and caused him, and those seeing this, pain for a fair few years. When he died the family was very sad but, underlying, was the sense he was no longer suffering, and therefore neither were they having to watch it. Now maybe it'd have been possible with loads of money etc to extend his life another 5, 10 years - but even if it's possible would you want to? Would you want to keep someone suffering, watch them suffering day after day just so they were 'there'? Basically, do you believe in euthanasia? Now I know mental health can not be put in the same bracket, but to dismiss it entirely would not fit with the consensus that it is a serious disease. I therefore argue that my 'suffering' and those watching my suffering would not want me to die but ultimately feel better quickly rather than trying to keep me suffering just so I'm here. That's love to me, it's recognising that as much as it may hurt you or you'd miss them, that they'd be happier elsewhere. It's no different to seeing a friend leave the country, you'll miss them and might never talk to them again but it's what they need to do for themselves. I don't think if you love someone you would force them to carry on suffering just for you. I also don't believe if you love someone you allow yourself to be the one that hurts them so you take yourself away.	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667

"I imagine we're straying wildly away from the crux of the thread but I think fundamentally we kind of agree. But even simple things like food and shelter are certainly easier now - even if you can't afford it, in this country anyway, you are provided for. Trade has always been used since civilisation was formed, even if the currency has changed so people have always had to jump through hoops to meet their very basic needs. Even now, if you think of absolute necessities, it's quite easy to achieve that - take away TV, phone, entertainment, snacks etc and absolute bare essentials (all people had hundreds of years ago) are very easy to achieve. The problem arises, we agree, when your wishes/knowledge grows. We should be happy to just want food and shelter but we are conditioned to want more, no one would be happy in this day and age without their luxuries. It's an extension on Maslow's needs - where true happiness comes from is really where your knowledge sits comfortably with your reality and your needs. So hundreds of years ago people hoped for house and food and were happy if that was largely comfortable, whereas now the 'basic' need is often a job, or a TV etc.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

On a more personal note, dare I suggest some advice if I'm getting the issue behind your belief, if I'm wrong I apologise; don't waste time figuring out how it got to be like this (unless it is academic) but focus instead on how you can survive it. There are some things we can not change, we're not going to suddenly lose hundreds of years of evolution whether it'd be better for us or not, so forget it if you can. It can lead you down a horrible path when you focus on what could have been and yet have zero chance of changing it.

"Hi, I'm feeling much the same at the moment - which is why I'm back on a depression forum...	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
HOWEVER. To give you some hope, I'm going to list some of the things that helped for me. I had depression for around 15 years, probably longer and kept plugging away, fighting it in every way I knew how. I had multiple courses of therapy and counselling, different anti-depressants, I even self-diagnosed with various illnesses because I was so sure that there was a biochemical reason for the depresssion, and wanted to fight the cause, not take anti-depressants for the effects. Long story short I have discovered a few things that help:	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
1. Therapy. Please don't give up with this, I had loads of useless therapy (eg. rubbish therapist/ wrongly targeted - I could tell you some stories!) but then had a course of psychodynamic therapy which was great. It didn't feel as though it was working at the time, but afterwards, I was in one of the situations which would normally upset me, and a switch went in my brain, and so much fell into place. AFter that I had 10 years of feeling pretty good. TEN YEARS. That's something to fight for, right? Just recently I'm starting to crumble again, but I've had those ten years, and I have hope I can get more with help.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
2. Medication. I was tried on SSRIs, and to start with they worked ok-ish, but then I developed an intolerance to them even in tiny amounts, so my doctor tried me on an SNRI. It took me 6 months to settle into it, and for the panic attacks to subside, but it changed physical things I didn't know I was missing, for example, seeing colours properly. After 20 yrs of muted washed out colour (I didnt' even know what I was missing, thought it was normal) I still get joy out of looking at something as simple as a piece of vivid blue plastic.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
3. On my endless quests for self-diagnosis for the CAUSE of the depression, I have discovered that Vitamin D3 really helps. I was prescribed around 3000iu a day. I now only take 2000 when I remember. This is not sounds science, just observation. Please do your own research. Oh, and I think you're supposed to take magnesium because vit D can deplete it.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
4. I was recently diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME). The treatment in the UK is CBT and excercise. However, being stubborn, once again I refuse to just chat about how tired I am so I did my own research on the internet. I found a site which connects CFS with disturbances in gut flora (friendly bacteria) and the more I researched, the more I found that this is a very new area of study which is being properly investigated by actual scientists. The theory is that we all need a VARIETY of friendly bacteria and if you just keep topping up with yoghurt, you only get one kind. So I found a supplement on the internet with around 30 different kinds, and the good news is that it has not only given me more energy but improved my mood. Again, this is just my own observation, not double blind trials or anything, but to my mind, it's worth sticking with as it can't do any harm.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
5. For the girls, get your iron levels checked. If you can't seem to supplement your iron fast enough, see your doctor about reducing your monthly bleed.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
So yeah, I've spent 25 years fighting this thing that blights our lives. At the moment I'm not winning, and I'm very very tired of doing it on my own, but when I look back to how hopeless I was in my 20s I know I've come such a long way. I think what I'm trying to say is try everything, take every offer of help you get. You don't know what will make a difference - and some things will. Oh, and I do the same thing with the jokes with the therapist, it's rooted in the stigma of depression; try to let them in, they've seen it before and won't judge. If you do feel judged, find a new therapist.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

I used to feel like I had no reason for being depressed either, but some psychologists I've seen have made me realize there's actually quite many things. Have you ever considered the fact you might have something in your youth that triggered your depression? There's so many different, even insignifcant seeming things that can affect our psyche. Allthough personally I'm against the whole idea that all our problems stem from our childhood, I have to admit there is some truth to it. Some of the issues don't start popping up untill the later years. To me it seems like your caring side might be a part of the cause, it not the biggest, for your depression. But even if there's no ''real'' reason for the cause of your depression like you say, doesn't mean you shouldn't be. Even the smallest thing can start the downwards spiral, and leaving it unattended only makes you fall faster. Like me, I completely burned myself out in my youth, trying to help a person that didn't deserve my help to begin with. The burnout slowly turned into depression, which went on unattended and left me pretending I'm fine. Now it's in a point where I can't even pretend anymore. So I basically started depression from nothing like you say. Sure, during the time other stuff happened, before that and later on aswell. I can now say I have a very good reasons to be depressed, but the start? That was mostly due to my own stupidy and stubborness. I should have left the person I tried to help. If I had, my tale now, 10 years later might be very different.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I guess what I want to say is, you're too similar to me to be boring. *grin* And that there's no good or bad reasons to be depressed. Even if someone else suffered 'more', only the person in question can decide how much damage it did. Sometimes, it may seem as if someone deserves to suffer more because of their circumstances, but that doesn't mean you're not entitled to it. Pain is pain and it's all bad.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
...Hmm. I hope that doesn't come off like I'm belittling your pain. That's not my intention, but I don't know how else to say it. That's me trying to sound smart and wise - not a good idea! Anyhow, wether you end up reading this or not - I wish you all the best. Keep that gf of yours, she clearly genuinely cares about you a lot. I'm sure you give her a lot more than you think. You actually remind me of a person I used to know a lot. He also couldn't see how great he was, despite his problems and ended up pushing me away. (it's not you though, don't worry, I don't live in the UK) But clearly you see something special in this girl to keep her around for so long - so don't throw that away.

"Thanks for your comments. You're definitely right, I don't really pay much attention to any compliment - it sounds fake or like someone is patronising you. I know it's my issue but can't change it! A few people say I remind them of Jon Richardson (8 out of 10 cats) and I see it - well bar the success, clear complexion, growing confidence etc!! I think a lot of people use humour to cover their insecurities or lack of self-esteem and that's why I'd say a majority of people with depression aren't easily identifiable - we're not crying in the corner but being light and 'quippy' in public before getting home and lying on the bed so shattered from the public persona we try to portray. Funnily enough I was a writer before I was a teacher, albeit briefly but, surprise, I wasn't very good at that either - not enough original thought!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
This 'smart' thing both irritates and interests me. I've mentioned previously, I feel that knowledge can be a bit of a curse. Yes there is the side of it being linked to being boring but there is also the feeling that ignorance is bliss. Don't get me wrong, I'm not intelligent in the slightest! I can get by etc but I know a million people who are way more intelligent that me, I'm very average... maybe just a little lazy too! I have never studied/ revised for anything but seem to manage but I'm certainly not a top of the class, super intelligent type! Me and a former colleague (teaching) used to comment 'who are the stupid ones?' the undereducated teen parents who are given all they need on benefits whilst seeing their friends and taking all kinds of illegal substances or us, working hard for no reason, little gratitude and a public perception that we're lazy?! Not a simple answer when kids are talking of their PS4s and how they're going to Disney World etc when you're struggling to pay for your student fees and afford the up coming MOT!! Ah, little rant unrelated to anything there!!	1	1	0	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					0.6666666667	
I have managed to push everyone away too, there is no-one but my GF and immediate family, but considering I come from a large family I can see that reducing too. I already don't speak to over half my siblings and finding the others increasingly hard work. My nephews used to be a highlight but they are growing up and no longer need the 'fun' (I could manage that around them!) uncle. I can see me losing contact with them all when my parents are no longer around as the 'glue'.	4	3	4	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					3.666666667	
Having a son, whatever you feel, makes you incredibly useful and not a burden - at least not yet if I'm honest. You clearly love him so you are there for him and you're not doing anything to burden him, you don't make him pay your bills or pick you up from anywhere or try to make you feel happy. If you think about it, I bet it's quite a one way street as regards emotions like it is with most children/ parents. Even now, I think my parents help/listen to me more than I do them as that is their 'role' and they would have done the same with their grandparents. As long as you're not emotionally offloading on to him, despite how frequently you see him or directly impact on his life, I'd say it's impossible for you to be a burden on him. And to prove that isn't just a nice fluffy comment, I'll be honest and say that doesn't mean you are a great influence either; another words whilst you can't be a burden on him, how much help you are to him IS an avenue you can explore. Happily it is quite a nice one to think about; if you're only 10% a good mother to him now that's still a positive amount! And it means you're working form a positive to a positive if you want to have more of an impact on his life. Does any of this make sense?! Oh, and just for the record, I'm NOT saying you're a bad mother!! I'm just saying you basically can't be a burden (a negative) but you can only be percentages of a positive. In a linked way though, reaching my mid thirties, I point blank refuse to be a father as I feel I have nothing to offer a child and wouldn't make a good dad at any stage of their life. However, depsite that, I know I couldn't be a burden to any child. I can be a burden to my peers and my family who feel they should look after me and you may feel that too but I can basically guarantee your child doesn't see you as a burden and wouldn't be better off without you. Even kids who hate their parents would rarely be better off without them. I'm going to keep going on this one....! Write down HOW your child would be better off without you, I almost like the argument in that I can't think of a way even if I was trying to argue for arguing's sake!! When it comes to my gf I think she'd be better off financially (your son doesn't pay for you) that she could find a better partner (your son can't get a better mum - he's 'stuck' with you!) that she shouldn't have to put up with my crap (I doubt you share this stuff with your child) and I'm holding her back (it's impossible to hold a child back - even if you want to!!). Seriously, overstating my point but you are NOT a burden to your son and he would NOT be better off without you. If you don't feel like you're doing enough then that's another issue but it's a good one to focus on as anything you add to what you currently do is only adding positives on to positives. With kids you can only go from neutral to positive so just keep thinking of how to add more weight to the positive side if it bothers you.	1	1	3	1.666666667	0.6666666667	0.6666666667	1.333333333					1.666666667	
I still greatly doubt things stem from my childhood. I had a fairly standard upbringing (although middle child syndrome?!) but the rest of my family are quite confident and loud. Half of them went super successful and the other half went off the rails and had families and struggled financially. Although a bit of a sweeping statement, both sides are happy with the choices they made to end up where they are. I went along the 'successful' route but ended up in the struggling financially destination. I did all the 'right' things but got nothing out of it. I ended up in the same place as they ones who did the 'wrong' things but without the fun, the family, the large social circles that come with those decisions! You're right about me caring too much - I recognise this and not in a martyr kind of way, but in a 'why do I care what a random stranger thinks of me but I really really do, kind of way. But that's also tied to self worth to some degree, someone else always deserves it more than me so I'll give anyone anything as I don't deserve it. I can work for hours on someone else's CV or train them to get a job they're probably not qualified for because they're nice people but I'll pay only lip service to anything that may benefit me. This isn't helpful in work as it's largely about self-promotion and 'look at me' rather than any actual qualities you may bring to the table.	4	3	3	3.333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					3.333333333	
The idea of depression being there is the worst thought I can have. If it's unfixable then I really don't want to continue. Would you keep a car with a broken engine? You try to fix it, but if all avenues have failed the you send it to scrap. I'm a write-off at the moment!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I'm going to jump down your message a little (I read and read again as I write) and say even though you were joking, you got the paranoid side of me out when you said it 'wasn't you' in regards to a guy you knew - the only way this works for me is knowing that no-one knows me and no-one I know reads this!! So, being slightly paranoid, I looked at a few other posts you'd written in different threads. The reason I'm mentioning this is, to get off the boring topic of me for a bit, is that I don't think you give yourself enough credit for both what you've had happen to you or how you have dealt with it. Returning to where I was in your message, I don't think your issues have appeared from nowhere at all and you have valid reasons for feeling the way you do. You also recognise that you are worth more than some people demand. It is not wrong to make mistakes, it's wrong to not recognise them as mistakes (even if you make them a million times again!!). I'm no expert at all, but at the 'start' maybe you didn't give yourself enough leeway/slack and that's what kicked off the rest of the stuff - you probabaly were depressed at the start but just didn't think it was important enough to get depressed over!	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667	
I recognise that everyone is different and a minor set back for one can be a significant mountain for another. I agree completely with you, pain is pain and circumstance and history do not dictate what should hurt and what shouldn't. We should all try to accept we can't change the past so there is no point thinking about it really, where's the benefit in it? So we should plan a route to the future. You don't need to be happy now, you just need to plan a route to where you might be happy in the future. We'll stumble and fall along the way but I believe that if you can plan that route to where you want to be then there is always enough hope to carry on and be happy it small successes even if you never get exactly to where you want to be. The issue I have is I can no longer see a destination or route that will achieve those goals.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
You come across smarter than you think. You recognise a few issues that have resulted in you being where you are and if you can plan a route to where you want to be then maybe there is hope for you. I've beaten you in to submission by telling you it's impossible for you to be a burden to your son and hope you seek the support you need from the places you need it.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I didn't feel like you were belittling my pain at all, far better to just write as you feel rather than try to pussyfoot around tricky subjects. I'll probably end up pushing my gf away, I always do but you're 100% right in that she is special - but that in itself makes it less likely that I can persevere as it means she deserves far more than I am capable off.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
You can't leave your son, even if you do you're never actually gone so it's kind of pointless. You'll always be his mum. You can't be an ex-mum! Once he arrived, that's it. So, again recognising I have no education on the matter, I'd recommend you forget thinking you can be a burden to him (as you can't) and think about how you can add to his life. Even the best mums in the world COULD do more, so if you're going to sacrifice everything for him then you can do that positively. in a ridiculous scenario you could devote your whole life to him, every penny you have goes to him, every minute he's available you're there for him. If you want to give up your life, then just give it to him instead! On a more serious note though, if you take this line of thinking on board, you may find there are secondary benefits - say you can pick him up from school x number of days a week, you get to know a few other mums who are standing by themselves waiting for their kid (ignore the bitchy gaggle of parents that are present in every class group!!) and that begins to widen your social group. Take him to a club once a week (football, athletics, cinema - whatever you have around you) and again you may find a few like minded souls. You may find instead of feeling like a burden to him you feel like you are enriching his life even a little. And from my point of view, you may sudddenly find he's started enriching yours from a direct point of view but also from the secondary ones noted above. Your son gives YOU a reason to fight; you can help each other.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
"I am a little confused rsig. Now to start, I am not trying to offend, and I will limit my criticism. You have responded to every post, and some of your advice is good. Not that any of your posts are bad in any way, because they are not. My questions is what are you looking for? I have walked this planet for the past 40 years feeling the same as you've described. Your statement ""I feel like I'm not really worth anything"" perfectly describes my state of mind. And no, I do not self harm or have the desire to - don't panic. But, feeling this way for so long, and living in isolation (to a certain degree) for all of these years has left me reading about this problem, but not really caring for what others have to say. Noone can totally feel like I do. And the reverse is true as well. No one really cares when I speak, what my issues in life are, nor my achievements in life. Your profile seemed quite similar, except you seem to communicate with everyone who writes and you offer quite a lot of advice. So what ARE you looking for? How can you describe me so well through your self description, yet be so different on this forum. Just curious. It may be helpful to me. And BTW - yes, I AM selfish. But I have earned it. Sad, eh?	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

So to try to respond to your comments I'll summarise it as 'fair point' and 'I don't know' and 'it's complicated'!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Your comments are certainly fair in there sometimes seems no continuity in my thought processes or actions; I shy away from people but answer everyone on here, I struggle to see worth in myself yet see the hope in others, I have no fight in my own life but urge others to fight in theirs. Why this is I'm not sure. I completely agree with you though - no-one else feels totally like you do, you (and I) are unique in our being and whilst similarities may be strong, we are bound to deviate in places and have different triggers, wishes, desires and flaws that need facing in a unique way.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
So what am I looking for? Good question. I don't know. Not to feel like I do? Not to cry sometimes for no reason? To feel hope for the future? To forget the pains of the past more readily? To feel useful? All of these and a million more things to different degrees of importance. Maybe knowing what I'm looking for would even be enough. It's a very good question but I don't know the answer.	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667	
So finally, why do I respond on here? Complicated. Again, there is no one right answer. Fundamentally I feel a strong compulsion to reply to every message, like it's polite to. Then there is the element where it makes me feel better to feel useful (advice). There's also the human part of me that craves interaction, having no friends and being home alone for long hours. Maybe part of me (certainly at the begining) that was hoping for the 'magic wand' to make myself feel better. Some of it is boredom, some of it is helping others and some of it is helping me. Why do I find it easier to chat on here? Simple; you don't know me, it's the most honest I can be. I don't even picture what the person I'm writing to looks like. Weirdly, I'm acting the most human I ever do when I treat those I am communicating with as if they are a simple computer. I'm just reading text and replying to text, it's almost as if there isn't another person reading it. That probably makes little sense.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
So to try and answer you, and maybe help you as you suggested, the answer is I don't know! Do you know what would make you happier? You must have some hope or wish for a better mental health if you're on these boards at all.	0	0	1	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					0.3333333333	
I think, for both of us, the reasons and the solutions will be highly personal and yet relatable with many but not 'one'. Maybe that's why I reply to everyone; I don't expect anyone to be a replica of me but I see an element of them in myself. Some more strongly than others. So by identifying and helping an individual, I perhaps help a small part of myself.	1	0	1	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					0.6666666667	
Unfortunately, and I recognise the stupidity, I am the epitomy of 'do as I say, not as I do'! So whilst I recognise the right mindset, the right choices and the right attitude, I still struggle to see it in myself. Who know's, may be were both a little 'happy' being grumpy?! I do say this without any sense of drama at all, but I genuinely hate myself, my way of thinking, my cynicism and my pessimistic nature. I wish I was the chilled, confident, positive and believed in something person I want to be but feel I've reached a point of no return. Almost like I now know too much to be happy. I've said it before, ignorance is bliss but I can now not escape my feelings and knowledge of the future to be happy.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
Finally (actual finally!) the person who writes on here is nothing like the person you'd meet in person. I'm not chatty, I won't offer advice, I wouldn't mention there was a problem and I would share feelings.

"I think i know how you feel... growing up i was always the smallest, the weakest, the least tallented, the one everyone had to slow down for just to keep up. I felt absolutely useless like nobody needed me and I thought that if i just weren't there that maybe everyone would be able to continue and succede at what they wanted to do without having to worry about me. After i realized these thoughts, i fell into a depression. Honestly i didn't even feel depressed. Not angry, not sad, not alone, just helpless and dissapointed in myself... I didn't want to die necessarily, nor did I want to live. i just didn't want to have to exist. After I finally made the decission to follow through with the former I was suddenly thrown into an array of situations that I couldn't leave unsettled, and because of that I had to force myself to get over my problems. If i was expendable, I told myself, then maybe I could at least be of some use. None of the situations have been resolved yet I've found that by helping them, I was able to help myself become the person who could help others, the kind of person I'd grown up both admiring and cursing. If you want to contribute to other people then first you have to help yourself. Find something within you worth saving and force yourself to do something, even if you're ready to collapse. Eventually You will find something in life worth hanging on to and equally as dependant as you. and Your family and girlfriend all love and treasure you. My father and grandfather were estranged during my grandfather's death and everyone involved regreted the separation afterwards.

However, it's a common theme: help yourself by helping others. Most people would say I do that TOO much. I will help others endlessly to the detriment of myself as I value anyone's progress above my own. I have given up things for myself to help a near stranger succeed above me. Especially at work, I often actively passed praise on to others or accepted blame that was not mine to save them. It's actually quite harmful if you think about it as it just helps fulfill a belief you have about yourself.	2	1	2	1.666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					1.666666667	
Helping others hasn't helped me. I still do it too, not like I've given up with that tact as it is ingrained in to my personality. But it doesn't make me feel better about myself, it doesn't make others think better of me (I'm almost invisible) and, despite continuing with quite altruistic actions, I firmly believe there is no justice - the good don't get rewarded and the bad don't get punished. I actually think being nice is BAD for me.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
In fact I believe the happy successful people in life are, by and large, the ones who don't dwell on the views of others either negative or positive and just take and use as they see fit to progress.

Anyway, my initial reason for contacting you, other than that I think you are a very thoughtful and articulate person, albeit one prone to depression and excessive rumination as I am, is that I am curious about your reasons for leaving the teaching profession. You see I have just had a terrible experience as a supply teacher in a British state high school, largely due to the execrable behaviour of this current generation of high school kids as well as the laughable 'discipline and support system' that currently operates in British high schools. I am from Australia originally, although I have taught English and Dance in various capacities in 5 countries now, but I have to say the behaviour I have seen in schools over here is the worst Ive seen ANYWHERE!!! Have you read 'You're wasting your own time'??? (Written by a British ex teacher). Because in my experience it's all true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Yes so my long winded point being I wondered if part of the reason you left teaching was because of the hideous behaviour of the students here? Certainly if that was at all a factor, I also just wanted to say I dont blame you and nor do at least half the British teaching profession who eventually end up leaving for another field!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
To finish my own rant here, I'm still recouperating after the shattering experience I have just gone through... still very disorientated, still weighing upmy options but ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY NEVER SETTING FOOT INSIDE A MIXED ABILITY STATE HIGH SCHOOL EVER AGAIN!!! They're worse than farm animals if you ask me!!! And I'm not bothered if that sounds elitist. It's the sad truth!

First, you obviously are at a very low point but you indicate this seems to be entirely in response to your work experience.

Teaching. Man, I could rant too! However, I would temper that by saying every school is WILDLY different. Just because one is awful doesn't mean all are. Inner city in this country tends to be a lot harder to teach, where as suburbs and rural areas can tend to go the other way and have very unrealistic pushy parents. State school is not your enemy though. I have taught in a lot of schools and you wouldn't believe how they can change from one side of the road to the other. Staff make a far bigger impact than children. I like to believe all children are inherently pleasant and want to achieve, the only thing that lets them down can be parents/environment, poorly organised schools and... yes stupid government policies! But this is largely a chat for TES site - head there if you've not before and you'll get a lot better answers to teaching issues than I can provide. I also worked primary and, by and large, my issue was always with staff who still act like they are on the playground as they know no world different from education and still think the popular, loud, bully kids are the ones who run the joint! I am often secluded because I'm male. However, again, I also recognise that it is also a large part of me that struggles to deal with things rather than letting it not effect me - basically what I'm saying is I personally feel my character is not really strong enough to deal with one of the most demanding professions in the world - especially in this country. Most of the public would laugh at that statement but they don't realise the daily abuse, work, stresses, observations, impossible targets etc - it is the most mentally challenging job out there and when you go home you still have work to do, none of this leaving it at the office, still got to plan and mark and assess. I know (knew) police officers, nurses, labourers, lawyers who all turned to teaching for holidays and the view working with kids was fun (which it can be) but then all returned to their orignal jobs when they realised the mental strain it puts on you and those around you. No-one should say it's easy til you've tried it - there is no other profession in Britain where you can be watched working and assessed on a weekly basis.	2	1	2	1.666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					1.666666667	
But I try to tell me, and I'll tell you, that it doesn't make you a bad person if you can't cope in British schools. I wouldn't chastise a child for struggling in P.E. and it's the same thing, some of us are made to excel in some areas and underperform in others. If you think you are a good teacher elsewhere in the world (and on a side note all the people in this thread who are from x country but working on y country make me feel evern more useless - how cool and brave you all are!) then maybe it's a case of just finding the right school. If not, try something else I suppose.

Ahh yes, well to be more candid, my crappy experience at a state high school which was mishandled by my agency, the school involved and resulted in an unfair suspension, continues!! However I have now spoken to the senior LADO for the area and who was incredibly sympathetic and has given me avenues to clarify the situation. Hopefully my career wont now be completely blighted by an errant 13 old and his gormless friends. Unlike you, I don't see children as all sunshine and light I'm afraid.

I did however wish to point out that unfortunately NO my depressive tendencies are not confined to my dissatissfaction with the teaching profession altho it has to be said the recent situation has certainly tipped me over the edge. (Not that you could have known that so please dont think I have taken any offence by yr assumptions). No unfortunately added to my mix are some residual unresolved family issues, disgust at the racial discrimination I and so many other ethnic minority people have suffered in various industries growing up in western countries and beyond that the particularly soul crushing addition of being an ex ballet dancer who is probably in a state of career transition - even though she'd happily break her left leg to be back on the stage again!!! Haha. Yes truly, with all that on my plate it's enough to want to grab your dinner knife and end it all. So I of all people, with this amount of baggage to claim do understand how tiring this life is. Presently I feel I have no energy at all. Have tried so hard in this life to achieve something exceptional and to what end? It all just seems a fatuous waste of time. Anyway, I do hope you find something to inspire you to go ahead with your life but I do warn you, put to much heart and soul into it and it can be equally if not more devastaing. Seems to me a life sitting on a couch could be far more peaceful for most of us given what is out there!!!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I recognise issues can tip you over the edge and it certainly sounds like you have plenty of reasons to not be happy at the moment. You have clarified that it wasn't just a bad experience but a career tthreatening one. So whilst my advice to speak to fellow teachers on TES may help with the more general issues, you sound like you're getting the right support and advice in dealing with the bigger picture. I can empathise, I had a similar issue with unions and cases etc (capability procedures against me which were eventually proven to be bullying from them) but I can say even after that experience I have found occasional good schools/ staff. I don't believe all children are lovely, I'm not stupid ha ha! But, and this might be more relevant in Primary, I still believe it is the staff that largely dictate the environment you work in, from direct interaction with you to how the kids respond to them, the routines and the expectations.	1	1	0	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					0.6666666667	
I can't empathise with any discrimination you feel you have had but I would say, as you probably well know, that general statements such as x industry or y people don't like me working there isn't fair as there are varying individuals in every part of life and some (hopefully a majority) would not discriminate at all. The closest I have felt to discrimination would be being a male in a very female dominated and being openly questioned and judged or secluded for that.

I'll ignore you advice to not try to hard, I agree with it, but it's probably not very healthy! One slightly cheesy line I sometimes repeat to myself is ""how can you be happy if you've never been sad?"" You need to know there are peaks and troughs and the zombie, nothing effects you life won't help. I know I'm sad now, I know that I've been sad for ages but I just hope that means that I'll recognise and appreciate if and when I'm happy. If that makes any sense...!	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
One final note, and apologies for any further assumptions, but you actually come across as quite the opposite from giving up. You sound like you have a lot of fight in you, anger and disappointment in the world and with that will inside you, you may find some form of talk therapy wouod help you greatly with every aspect that gets you down. Therapy doesn't work for me because I can't escape the blame I put on myself, the dislike I have for myself and my unwillingness to fight or talk through apathy.

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply. Given your own experience of the British education system and its circumlocutory bureaucratic procedures, you can no doubt appreciate that I was up to my neck in red tape. So much so I could easily have hung myself several times over. Anyway I am here to report that fortunately I have not had to resort to that. The other main reason I stopped by was just to let you know that the allegation against me mounted by a child wanting to get a teacher into trouble, just because they could, HAS BEEN DROPPED! When the police sought a statement, the family and child ignored all queries. Multiple messages were left by the school and liaison officer which they didnt bother to respond to over a two month interval so it is all now pretty much done and dusted. I'm just waiting for the paperwork to come through which is a mere formality. In other words, NO FURTHER ACTION IS GOING TO BE TAKEN. I am deeply relieved and it is gratifying to know that at least sometimes the wrongly accused do get some justice in this world. Having said that, the whole ordeal has deeply shaken my faith in the state education system and certainly proven to me how vulnerable teachers are within it. So I think I may look at a new career or at least make a return to tutoring and or dance instruction. SO HOW DO I FEEL NOW MENTALLY? LIKE A WHOLE TRUCK LOAD HAS BEEN UNLOADED, THANK GOD!!! However it is early days of my new job seeking routine so no doubt that will throw up some significant hurdles. Furthermore the ""other stuff "" I need to sort out in my life/head and or fight for will take time, so yes I think a return to a therapist will be my next port of call.	5	5	3	4.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667	1.333333333					4.333333333	
I read something from another of yr responders who said that a gifted athlete who suffered a chronic injury and was never quite able to get back to peak performance decided to top himself. ""Hmm"" I thought to myself, I can definitely relate. [Sorry if that sounds terribly egotistical]. I also read anout yr reaction to Robin Williams. Yes I found that very disturbing also. I think poor old Robin was at times plagued by his tendency for perfectionism and the need to better his best all the time. And let's face it, who can keep that up for a lifetime??? But as well as all his inner turmoil, I think he had a profound awareness of the unfairness and chaos of this life we all share. And I think all rolled up together, it all just got too pointless and or too painful for him to bare...Anyway that's my take on that. No bloody use to anyone quite probably, but thought I'd air those thoughts anyway.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
As for you Rsjg. Glad to see you are still soldiering on. Really wish I could say something to you that would make you feel more inspired but I can't. Half the time I am so bewildered and despondent for various reasons that I understand those that dont bother with life far more than those who do.

But to my point, say with work, what job would you want and is it achievable with extra qualifications - I know plenty of people who have returned to education in the later years, utilising after work classes and just working their backsides off to get where they want to be. This might not be applicable to you of course - the experience think is ridiculous catch 22 and the only way I know to get round it is either luck or, if your field of work is suitable, offering your services for free/doing the job with no extra pay until you can leave and take that experience with you - I have been 'acting' in management roles with all the responsibilities and no pay before just to add that to my CV.

Is wanting to die 'blamelessly' selfish? Yes. I can't see how it's not. But I understand and I wish that too. It's absolutely abhorent when you think about it - wishing to be ill when there are thousands of people who just want to be well. I wish I could swap with them but there is no getting away from the fact it's a selfish though. But, largely, isn't depression that? The complete focus on yourself and your inadequecies when you know you should be able to put it in to perspective? I've touched on this in posts before.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Listening in itself is the key to being a good listener, I try to steer away from the very male response to want to fix everything - I've learnt that a lot of women (no sweeping generalisations meant) have preferred the listening element to anything I've had to say! Just an agreeing head, a sympathetic mind, and unjudgemental approach and it can be enough to make people feel better - they get it off their chest. I wouldn't worry too much about talking unless it's a real issue, if you can hold a conversation you're like 75% of the population and just not super chatty like others.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

It is selfish definitely, you're only thinking about yourself not the others around you, although I would hate to accuse anyone who was pushed to the point they saw no other option in their life other than to do so. Relating to the ""listening"" part, Few years ago I was talking a lot with a friend where a family member had just commited suicide. I was listening a lot, about the family, situation before and after, the letter that was left behind etc etc, but I started to think too much about the person who had commited suicide, the life they had and the process where they got to that point, and with this coming at the same time when there was a breakdown of a relationship with people at work, I got really depressed. I would burst into tears on my break or in the toilets, didn't sleep for days and although it never managed to get to the point where I attempted suicide (Thanks to handful of close friends) I lost all energy and motivation for a long time.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Maybe, and everything is only an uneducated suggestion, you would be wise to compartmentalise for a little bit. With work you need to get some proper career advice, there are plenty of places to find it I'm sure. Get the knowledge you need to know where you need to be and what you need to do to be in the environment you want to be in. Once you've got that, you'll have a better grip on where you're heading work wise.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Then, turning to the 'head' side of things, you will be able to separate the work stuff from the 'you' stuff. I think it's never a bad plan to focus on something else rather than your own thinking anyway! If you get your work stuff sorted you may find you feel better overall, you often don't notice how much one thing can impact on you until it's no longer there. If you still feel bad though, maybe it will highlight what is really the issue that had been masked before to some degree. You've got something to focus on - your job/ career - so do that, put other stuff on the back burner and then return to it if you need to. Although assuming again, you seem relatively confident in what you do, it almost isn't challenging enough.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I always feel the truth is one of the hardest elements. I don't think I can ever say committing suicide isn't selfish. It is, but that doesn't mean it's not understandable. I have got to that point, I'm sure I will again. I accept that means I'm selfish. I hope that doesn't make me a bad person. In the same way if someone is bad at their job and gets sacked - it doesn't make them a bad person it just means they weren't made for that job. Failure doesn't equal bad. And being selfish doesn't equal being horrible. I think it's an emotive word, but selfishness is sometimes a good quality to have - in fact some may advocate it from time to time to help you get straight. It's all about getting balance.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
You sound like you took it to heart when you helped your friend and that shows a strong empathy you have. It may have triggered little issues you have yourself. I know a lot of therapists have therapists to help them deal with the issues they've heard. Just because you didn't know the person, their death can still hit you. Look at the out pouring of grief over the loss of life of that refugee child. You sound like you were traumatised to some degree and maybe you need to speak to someone about that. It can be particularly bad if things strike a chord with you. As for crying at everything, I completely understand.... In fact that's all I'll say. The key thing to focus on is you have a handful of friends to help you when you feel low, try to value and maintain that. I half wonder if the point I became beyond help was when I lost all mine; I pushed the away, I'd always been up and down but them finally going was probably not the best thing for me.	3	2	2	2.333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					2.333333333	
You sound like you've come through the worst of it to some degree, keep fighting upwards. There will always be triggers or issues that pick at our individual insecurities but the key is to find you own methods of controlling that.

Spot on - and the thing is, the way the company is heading, I won't be doing that for much longer when they outsource my job to an external party and I will be put in my previous role which I worked hard to get out of and will be a major step down.

No I don't think it's a bad thing either - I just don't seem to use that selfish-ness at the right moments to make my self happy. It was a bit strange when I was listening to the troubles I took it so to the heart. The person who had taken their life basically had a promising sports career where they belonged to a major sports group at a young age which was their dream, but through a serious injury then age they had to give up that dream which lead to their end. It's NOTHING like my life but I think I looked in too mcuh about what their thought process was when I was listening, piecing different parts of information together to provide an answer to how it came to this. I think I am over this incident itself, but I think the breakdown of relationships and my mind itself from it is the serious issue.	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667	
I worry about losing them too... and I lost a few after that incident. but maybe they were not THAT close to me in the first place. I don't know. I try to look at it from a third person's view about that situation back then, and I know I didn't act ""perfectly"" but I know why I was in a state where I could not act (or feel like I could act) in that way. Most of those who left made me feel guilty for being depressed. One of those who has stuck around is now got a depression now, and I hope I can be there for him like he was for me, and make sure not to act like those who made me feel isolated and alone.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
That's ok, I have no intention of forcing it out of you. Although maybe you need to find a way to change your surroundings, friends, work, lover etc etc. I know it takes courage to do so because I'm not doing it at the moment! I did find making a list of things you want to live for (or a ""list of reasons to stay alive"") helped me become positive a bit... not just like ""holiday/visiting another country"" but even if it's like ""watching the next episode of a TV Series"" or a ""New game that's coming out"", I found that I only really had handful of reasons I felt negative about, with a lot more things to look forward to.

Thank you anyway, I've applied for different roles in external companies now, and few recruitment agencies do want to speak to me (not that they ever lead to much in the past), maybe I should give my self a push and resign if I don't get through this interview (which is for an internal role).	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

"I'll keep the career talk to a minimum as I think there are probably better places you can get advice on that, either generic or for your specific line of work. What I would say is, unfortunately, you're right not to quit a job without something lined up. I know we watch these 'follow your dreams' movies but in reality you'll still have stuff to pay for and the longer you're out of work the harder it is to explain on a CV as they ask for the reasons behind the gaps and, as much as it isn't, it always just sounds like ""I could'nt be bothered to stick at a job I dislike"". The trick will be finding a way of enhancing your chances of getting to where you want to be through postition, interview, qulaifications or what ever other trick someone more knowledgeable than me will advice.

As for the person who commited suicide, you do not have to be anything like them to feel as if parts apply to you - they sounded like they had a plan and then didn't know how to acheive it when life threw a spanner in the works. Sounds a little like you. As I said, this is more professional advice that is needed and getting a doctor to refer you to a psychologist may help, it may only take a few sessions - if desperate you can even book your own for relatively little per session. Don't underestimate how things can effect you even if they don't seem that related. Robin Williams death greatly effected me despite me not being a world famous comedian with millions in the bank or being a performer and life of the party. It was the element of putting on a public front and then eventually 'it' still getting you. It can be tenuous but lots of things might have struck a chord with you.	2	2	1	1.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					1.666666667	
To friends. It's a tricky one, on one hand if they did disappear then maybe they weren't good friends, on the other maybe I pushed them so hard they couldn't stay. Furthermore, maybe fear keeps them away - very few people really understand mental health issues, even if you do try to explain it to them. Hard when you can't explain it to yourself! Actually I never really told my friends I had issues, I just pushed them away and they didn't really fight. The one who knew more than others I simply think didn't understand or value the issues. I think ultimately people just gave up! I'm stubborn. Maybe I tested them to some degree too which wasn't fair, when they didn't repsond in the way I hope - everyone lost. I think what you're doing for your current friend will work because you know the thought processes, you know not to say 'just smile' or really irritating things like 'it'll all work out in the end'.... grrr, personal worst sentence you can say!	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
It doesn't take courage to change your life, often it takes fear. I normally change my life in a response to the 'fight or flight' response. I have changed everything about my life due to 'this', always with the intention of moving on to better things. But it doesn't work - sometimes you need to not change things and face the issues, otherwise you're just talking them to a new place and starting the same probelms from scratch until you reach the same place all over again. I have moved a fair bit, I have lost old friends and replaced them with new friends who I have now lost again. I have changed jobs to escape bad things and ended up being in exactly the same situation again in each one. I have left lovers because I feared they would be better off without me. I always change, but other than being proven right about my issues that doesn't always help! Sometimes I think it's braver to admit that it isn't because x,y and z keeps happening - it's simply because I am the problem.	1	2	3	2	1	0	1					2	
The list thing is a VERY dangerous plan ha ha. In the few visits to my therapist he suggested something along those lines and thinking about it makes me feel a hundred times worse! I actually can't think of anything that I want to stay alive for, eventually you're going to miss something even if you live to 100! Nothing greatly inspires me, the few things that might (like travel) are too expensive and make me realise how much of a drain on my partner I am. In fact every dream I had is now a nightmare as the reality is they are impossible and even the most positive of person admits that with me. I am plagued by logic and unfortunately, it's rarely disputable. Doesn't matter how much you dream it or want it, you're not going to be the first 75 year old footballer!

I assume with when Robin Williams passed away it was because he was a big figure when you were growing up? Or maybe the due to the characters he represented?	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
I know what you mean, I do feel with those that left me I was partly to blame, but at the same time they were really not the people I wanted to be around with. Say if I was able to go back in time, I COULD'VE gone to the doctors or something to take some time off work to get away from work environment, and maybe spoke to those friends back then outside in private. That most likely would've kept the friendship but then again, I think my career and work would've been affected negatively. Oh god I hate those comments!	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
THAT, is one of the worst things you could say to a person. I had something along those lines... ""If you keep working you will get out of it"" or something like that. Asking someone who's very close to completely losing the will to carry on to find some strength from nowhere is a very harsh thing to say, it’s like pushing someone who’s standing on a cliff edge.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
I remember one of the “friends” was upset because I didn’t tell them the issues I was having, and that they heard from another person who had… “I’m very upset that you didn’t talk to me about this”, but didn’t touch the actual subject of why I was feeling down, I just remember thinking “do you actually care about anyone but yourself???”. Maybe I’m just being bitter.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
I guess that’s the difference… are you doing something because you want to do it, or because you don’t want to be where you are at the moment? When you go from one job to the other, is it similar kind of job? Does the job itself not suit your personality? Like I know I never would be a salesman. I’m so much better at handling complaints (probably due to my listening habits) than being a pushy salesman, last time I changed jobs it was because my old job started to become sales focused. Haha at least you find a lover, you must have a fairly decent level of attraction, I haven’t been in a proper relationship… the closest one was when they cheated on their partner with me, and that sort of scenario has happened with me quite a few times. This seems to stem from the listening thing as well, troubled relationship, the opposite sex who will listen to them and then get with me.	1	1	0	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					0.6666666667	
Ok, don’t make a list haha. But just to give you an idea, when I made mine, the bad was just the “Work” and “Family”(Or “Parents” specifically), and for the good I listed all the TV shows, movies, places I want to go and see at some point in my life, restaurants or food I like eating, sports team I support and even unrealistic things like a Lamborghini (though I could probably go on those test drive things one day). When you talk about the logic – is it the age thing? So you can’t do something because you’re too old? I’m obviously not gonna say something stupid like “you shouldn’t give up”, somethings you just can’t do. Like that family member of a friend who killed himself, by the time he was back to full fitness from a serious injury he was over what the general idea of “peak age” of a sportsman’s career, and (from what I can make out) he was just not the talented promising star that he once was.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Thank you, the interviewers and I were pretty engaged in conversation but I don’t think I answered the questions as effectively as well as I had hoped.

Yeah I never been the type to work for long term plans, I know people say you should have a target etc. but if I can’t see a relatively instant result I don’t have the motivation.

​Although I am very guilty of not doing this myself (although I have tried and it's still not great!) I always think it's a good start to focus on those things that are good and not the negatives. I've said before, hope is more important than success - not saying you or anyone else have reasons for hope as that's impossible to say to a stranger, but that if you as an individual can find it then great.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
​You're young, that's definitely a plus. I do feel the quicker things are addressed the better so proactively take steps now to deal with it rather than waste 10-20 years wondering what if. Social awkwardness is understandable (trust me I'm nearly an expert!) but not unsolveable even in small amounts - especially when you are so young - the change from 21 to 30 is probably close to the change from 12 to 21. the fact you're even writing on these boards at such an age shows you have a good idea something isn't 'right'.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
​As for the positives, you say you ENJOY your job. Hell, you have and seem to be able to hold it. Three positives there in itself. Many friends is still some friends - don't focus on who's missing, have great fun with those you do have.

That should always be your first port of call - it is rarely a quick fix but some of these feelings (and sick and tired springs out) can be attributed to things that CAUSE depression and not from the EFFECT and may be solveable by increasing iron or another vitamin deficiency.

​As for death you're kind of right, although we're not supposed to admit it. We weren't alive before and we will be dead one day and the world will keep on turning and billions of people around the world won'y even know. But it won't be peaceful, it won't be anything. Don't think of death as being anything, anyone who imagines what life is like after they're gone is missing the point - there is no imagining, no peace, nothing. Focus on the living and how you can make that better. That doesn't mean I don't understand, empathise and even agree with you that life isn't worth living but you have to quantify that with what your life is like now, if it really is awful and makes you cry everyday and there is no hope then I understand the wish to depart, but it is only as a means on ending the pain it does not bring happiness or relief or peace - it brings nothing. The question is, is nothing better than living? I'm not going to try and answer that with such limited information - what I will say is I believe in euthanasia for those with incurable pain (much like the mind?) but also believe those that can be cured should not take that route.

Further more I blamed myself, I felt I'd let people down by not doing my job - securing the property adequately or ensuring the insurance was up to date. The fact they only took my bike and not others was good I suppose, but then it felt even more personal!

"Hello again thanks for your message, I'm sorry to hear about your bike being stolen - isn't that Sod's law, just at the time you had forgotten to renew your insurance. Try not to blame yourself for the insurance lapse, it's annoying but you didn't do it on purpose. I know from experience that when we are suffering from depression, we are quick to blame ourselves when things go wrong - even things beyond our control. I'm also sorry to hear that your experience of therapy didn't go well - should a therapist be using religion to help a patient? I would think that is a no no, so maybe you just had the misfortune to be paired up with the wrong therapist. I have had 2 separate bouts of NHS counselling this year, and I am now paying to see another privately because I need somewhere to go where I can talk openly and feel comfortable. Perhaps you could think about referring yourself tomIAPT (you can do this without having to go through your GP) (check online for details www.IAPT.nhs.uk). This may be a good way to start trying to get some help.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Your final sentence has a ring of truth to it - I was happy for 6 months in 1984! Beyond that, my life has been miserable and I am regularly just on autopilot getting through each day. My ""issue"" is probably one that millions of other people have, but I have let it take me over and ruin my life. I have always wanted to find love & settle down with that special person. Thought I'd found it once, but it wasn't meant to be. Kept searching, getting hurt and demoralised until 17 years ago I made the decision to give up looking and accept that I was meant to be alone. The years passed me by until this time last year I realised that I had fallen in love with someone; it hurts to be with them and hurts to be apart from them, someone who I have thought about every single day, someone who I have shed tears over but ultimately someone who I can't tell how I feel; the most unsuitable person I could have chosen to fall in love with.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3

i hope that it isn't too late for you to find that thing you have been looking for, but you say you have given up. Same here (see my reply to rsjg above), which as you say leads to more depression. We live with it because we know we have to but the pain is always there. We hide our true self from others, so that they don't see or know about the sadness and turmoil we are carrying around with us.

​Yes, the talk therapy evolved in to more of a theological debate, largely stemming from my insistence I saw no 'point' and him saying it was impossible without faith. I also know he found the sessions almost fun as he 'enjoyed sparring with me' but I think he kind of acknowledged he wasn't gettting anywhere. I don't want to see the Doctor again (he has a proper job to do!) and even more strangely I don't want to be refered back to the same clinic where all the therapists are as I'd feel worried/ even guilty about telling him I didn't think it was working and then asking for anyone but him. I know he wouldn't care but I'd feel anxious about upsetting him! Weird I know. I can't afford private at the moment, I already feel enough of a drain.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
​Love is such a tricky one and I certainly can not speak from any authority. I maintain it's never 'too late' but am not stupid enough to say 'oh it'll all work out in the end'. In this day and age it also doesn't take much to meet new people if you can face it - we would never be having this conversation if it wasn't for the internet! But, without proclaiming any intelligence on the matter, I always say to single people (of all ages) that meeting people does NOT have to be a romantic thing. Say you're on one of the dating sites and after communications you decide to meet. Why go with any expectations other than to have a new friend? This isn't directly aimed at you but an overall point. Meeting people for people makes meeting partners easier - going out looking for a partner is impossible. I have only ever dated women I have been friends with first, I assumed they weren't interested and got to know them as people!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​However, I may have wandered off your message. You have someone you like - how impossible is it? These are not questions I would expect you to answer, just to think about. If you did declare your love what would be the worst case scenario? Although a bit greeting card message - it really is impossible to be happy unless you risk everything for it. However, I also recognise that is all well and good in the movies, in real life not so much. If they're happily married, or 'inappropriate' in any way then the next step is not to look for love - but to fall out of love. You need to have a clean break, with absence and time people can fall out of love, or recognise it as an old love. People who are widowed don't love their lost partners any less, they just move on and find a different love with someone else. Does that make sense or am I being insulting in some way?! Like I said, I know not of what I talk about!! A slight aside; watch 'First Dates' on Ch4, it is entertaining anyway but there have been lots of older people (in to 70's and 80's) and they still enjoy life.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​What is a partner? It's a best friend you sleep wth if you cut it down to the crude essentials. Finding a best friend is trickier than finding a random person to sleep with. But friends are a lot easier to find than partners... so, for me, finding a friend means everything is possible. Finding a partner is an impossible task to aim for. Find more friends, be more sociable, see new people. Don't look for a partner, look for friends. Partners can't become friends, friends can become partners. And now I've finished this vomit enducing sappy/movie like statement I will counter it with the full acknowledgement that is far easier said than done. I struggle meeting friends, in fact I have none now, so I know some elements of what I say is just fantasy. However, I always think looking for a partner never works, it just evolves from something completely unrelated.	1	0	1	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					0.6666666667

Re my problems which I mentioned in my last message - the looking for love is not quite as straightforward as I made it sound. Plus the person I have fallen in love with would definitely be viewed as ""inappropriate"", and there is not a hope in hell's chance that the feelings are mutual. I know that, I've always known that but it hasn't stopped the way I feel. Maybe if I was a naive 18 year old I could possibly make sense of this, but I'm not and I can't.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
I've tried the online dating, initially just writing to a few people but ........ Nothing. Either they stop writing after a while or there's no spark there at all. In my day-to-day life I sometimes meet quite a few people, but again because my story isn't straightforward there's little possibility of anything developing. I don't have a social life, I have very few friends and am almost like a recluse (especially during the winter months).	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3

​Without being you, knowing the ins and outs of it, it is impossible to suggest what to do. You know what is and isn't possible and I can only give a sympathetic nod to what you must feel. Without wanting to seem patronising or insulting in anyway, is the fact it is so completely impossible not somewhat of a relief? I mean as much as that if someone or something is within reach then it is infuriating, turning your life in to a series of ""what if I just..."" with constant failure. If it is completely 100% impossible then your ONLY solution, as harsh as it sounds, is to somehow make peace with this. Now this actually gives you an aim, or something to talk about. Getting over this person, or finding a different passion should be your focus. I'm not saying that you will ever find anyone who may match this person but I'm sure you will acknowledge there is a danger of putting someone you have held in such high regard for such a long time on such a high pedestal that they are irreplaceable - much like fantasing about a celebrity, they're perfect. I don't know anyone who's perfect!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​When I write what I do, to you and others, I have to admit there is a level of devil's advocat and much of what I suggest is very much do as I say, not as I do! Again, in relation to the online dating, why stop? What really is the harm of chatting to new people? I'm sure there are more generic sites than strictly dating ones too. Take some solace in the fact few people's stories are straightforward, the one blessing we have in this world is you can contact more people than ever who will have a similar one to you. Gay, straight, black, white, transgender, ethnicity, religious beliefs, age gaps, disabilities, personal style and yes, even mental health issues, all have areas where like minded people can chat, look for comfort and get opinions. I'm sure your story is not so unusual that you could not develop things if you wished, I don't believe in soulmates - there are different level and different types of people for everyone. What one partner made you feel amazing in might be something the next doesn't, but they make you feel even better about something else.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​Do you want a social life? I ask that because it's a question I'm not sure I can answer myself. I love the idea of friends, I even miss the friends I had every day but I also question whether my mind is suited to them - I question and over-analyse everything and often feel worse about myself the more I am around others. So wanting to be sociable is a tricky area. However, if you do want to be sociable, what can be done about it? You're the second or third person on here I have spoken to of a similar age, if there is nothing to do in person then I'm sure there are places online. Very few friends is also some friends. Spend more time with them, if they want and you don't feel pushy. Are any of them alone? Winter months are particuarly bad time for lots of people, SAD kicks in even if mild, people stay in doors and the focus on family can become overbearing...	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
​Which brings me to your Christmas question. I love the magic of Christmas, there is an escapism feel to it. But the reality is much much harder. I have been fortunate enough to escape the last two years in New York to have a magical christmas (living an Xmas movies!) without family pressues but this year, due to money and other reasons, I'm back doing the whole family thing. And I'm dreading it. My family are ok, to lovely to amazing but it's just the pressure of acting confident, talking about my life and future, comparing myself to others and feeling very much the outsider I hate. I know most of this is me but by Xmas Eve I'm fairly sure I'll be in fight or flight mode! One year I literally had to be dragged from my house as I refused to leave it. Do you have family? If not, do you have friends that are also alone? What about volunteering somewhere Xmas day, do something different - I'm sure there are loads of people and institutions that need help or volunteers and would help you focus on things other than yourself. That's the key, focus on yourself and you'll only see things that are lacking or flaws, but go to a hospital or a old people's home or something and you'll be chatting to them.	2	1	2	1.666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					1.666666667	
And in truth, that's what I still do on here - that's why I'm still writing and replying ages after the initial thread. My feelings haven't changed, I have good days and bad and I do balance on the edge of trying and giving up but talking to yourself and others helps me take the focus away from me. Me is not a good subject. Look above and see all the different things I've said to different people - hopefully it helped them even one percent but it's helped me a little too. It's not helped me feel better about myself (often the opposite!) but it has achieved one simple aim - it stopped me thinking about myself for a short time. Depression is a selfish disease and I don't mean that in a bad way - most people on here seem fairly nice, caring and generoud - but it is the focus on what's bad about yourself. How you effect others. How I could be better. Not thinking about it for an hour is kind of nice.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

You write so well and make sense in your comments, you certainly sound very level headed.

My head and emotions are in turmoil (as they have been for the last year) and at present I feel like I just do not want to go on. The problem I have described a bit in my previous comments to you, is still very much at the forefront of all that is going wrong with my life, but it has now taken on an unexpected and worrying twist. Things could well come to an unpleasant conclusion later this week - I am intending to see the person I have fallen in love with, and right now rather than looking forward to it I am dreading it and am scared how it will pan out. The worst case scenario is that the meeting goes horribly wrong and I end up walking away for the final time - I fear that the bad news I am expecting will push me over the edge. Apart from my counsellor I have nobody I can talk to in detail about my problems and there does seen only one permanent solution to the awful emptiness, loneliness and never-ending crisis I am in. Whether I have the necessary courage to end it all, right now I really can't say. Nobody will miss me, so what is the point of going on?	3	4	4	3.666666667	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					3.666666667

​So once again I'm going to try and reply with honest intent, so please don't be offended if anything is way off base. You say that it has taken a worrying and unexpected twist - I think you need to look at it differently. I believe the worst part of most things is not knowing, good or bad. For example when waiting for a job offer you might be a bag of nerves but once the call comes, positive or otherwise, there is the release of tension. Obviously all those emotions are heightened when it is a relationship but you have to try and look at this weeks possible conclusion as closure - either it'll work out perfectly or it's finished forever.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​So plan for the worst. What's the absolute worst thing that could happen? The person doesn't respond in the appropriate way, shuns you. There are ripple effects that mean others shun you (I'm doing proper doomsday response here - I don;t know how inappropriate your feelings are). Is that really going to make you feel worse than you do this very minute? You already believe it anyway. So knowing you were right, knowing it was a disaster, what do you do? What can you do? You have to move on, as hard as it'll be. But surely that's a billion times better that this state of depression limbo where you hate day to day but keep going because of the whole 'what if'. It's like waiting to be sacked or something - you're fairly sure it's coming, you don't want it to but the pressure of it daily means then when it finally does come there is an element of relief.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​I think you're wrong no-one will miss you. I often think about 'going' but I still think people would miss me - just that they'd be better off. That's a different argument. But if we go back to your no-one will miss you argument and even assume it's true - then why care about them enough to do it? Find people (friends, work whatever) that would miss you for you. Family?	3	1	2	2	1	1	0					2	
​In fact I would go as far as to say, as much as I recognise the strong emotions of love and what it can make you feel and do, should one person dictate your happiness? Think about that - you're so focused on this person, why do they hold the key to everything? No-one is that good, no-one. Focus on YOU not them.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
​I hope it works out for you, but I suspect from what you say that it won't. I'm a realist. So all I will say is I, your counsellor, and probably loads of pother people on here and in your life will be more than happy to listen and help as you so desire. The worst case scenario is they 'die' to you -but that doesn't mean you have to - even widows move on, life moves on, painful as it may be for long periods of time. But love can be refound, remade, adjusted and different from one person to the next. Never put all your happiness on to one person, because even with the best will in the world it is inevitably going to fail.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Right. First things first - just grieve a little. It's not wrong to be upset. You should be. Just live each day by day until it hurts just a little less - you cried for three hours today because of the hurt, but I doubt you'll cry that much in a months time because time will pass, it'll still hurt but a tiny bit less.

Again, focus on the positives. At least you have two friends, so be the one to initiate contact, meet for a Xmas drink. It doesn't ned to be a big heart to heart, just a distraction, take yourself out your own mind. As for family, and friends for that matter, distance isn't important - I have closer relationships with family members who are hundreds of miles away than ones down the road. There's phones, emails, skype or just make time to travel every so often. Don't use distance as an easy excuse.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Love is never straightforward, even when it goes well. One lost love, whatever your age, sexuality, race or anything else does not mean game over. I don't believe in soulmates, you just fit better with some people more than others, all relationships require work, and you may well find, one day, someone else that fits well with you. But there's no rush, although now you must accept you should look - there is no 'what if' now.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
There's plenty to live for. At least two friends, some family that will like to hear a voice from home and the chance of a better life, a better mental health.

Don't make decisions in a period of grief, recognise it as that. If you still feel this strongly in 6 months to a year then I'd be surprised. You'll still hurt, I'm not silly, but you'll begin to see opportunities. There is no ONE person for anyone, so eventually you'll be able to imagine a life that hasn't got this one person on a pedestal. I truly believe that.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

"What a mess, life is made up of different people in your life year after year. Can't think about ending your life over of one relationship.. I've learned long time ago got to be able to live with yourself, love yourself, accept yourself before somebody else can.. There's always another woman that you will meet sooner or later. I know after a relationship that can be extremely hard to get over that person. If it's a first love that's a different story. You should get away from the situation and give her some breathing room.... that's the the only way it'll work... I've been there too many times . Bury yourself in work even if it's somewhere you don't want to work .. find a therapist and work on the second step! Work your problems out. You can never give up... I have a physically disabled and not many women are out there looking for somebody like me. My head is lying on my shoulder and I will probably end up alone.. I've learned and depend on being alone myself. But to think about killing yourself over a woman when there are so many out there.. Best thing to do is to go on a date.. Family is family and its unconditional love. Its good to have time away from family every once in awhile. If staying away and given her room doesn't work you have to find the strength to move on.. I know saying and doing it is a whole different story but you have to. It's hard to think of the aftermath of what would happen if you hurt yourself. Your family suffers for the rest of their lives. If there's any kids in the family please think of them because they will take the same way out one of these days, I'm not saying all of them but just one of them increases the chances..

"I stumbled upon this post on Google. I was bursting with tears while reading this. My reflection to every single word and I know how you feel. Although I'm only 26 I'm already tired of life. Maybe it's just momentarily but the fact is I lived your life for the past few years now and it's getting worse...	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
I started as enthusiastic, full of inspiration and many talents, people told me I have. They said I will become great one day. I realized I'm a bit above average when it comes to art and learning, not to bust my ego too much. Over the years I achieved my goals and my dreams when it comes to music. I was working day and night literally while others were partying and having fun. I had a vision which I claimed. The beauty of that is overwhelming and I'll always be proud of that. That was in my college years when I had so much time I didn't know what to do with now so precious luxury.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Few years ago I got ever so cought up into a thing called system. I started working full time job (not a bad one, but definitely now what I would want to do). Now I'm stuck here, working every day, besides my own company I spent a year working 14 -16 hours daily, trying to make a financial escape route for me to keep creating what I love to do. It was all for nothing. It's still early to talk about this but my energy is drained. I still live with my parents, no proper relationship to afford a self sustaining life.	2	2	2	2	0	0	0					2	
Another parallel cause and the biggest one of my current state is my love life. I had quite a few girlfriends over the years but none had time for me at the end even though I tried as hard as I could. Last few years were the worst. I have 3rd girl in a row with serious issues and events at home. One had drug addict dad at age of 4 which she had to take care of, while mom left both of them. She had terrible depressions. One had a really big farm at home they couldn't sell and only a demonic mother and 12 year old brother. She just lost her great father to cancer at that time. The one I'm with now has a deeply depressed unemployed extremely possessive mother who's brainwashing entire family since she was a child.	0	1	0	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
The second one ended in tragedy with a sudden cut. I hardly came back to right mind one year ago. But consequences remain... The fear of losing someone is just so sensitive now to me. It gets even worse because I do EVERYTHING to make it right I'm often a bit forceful with offering help. I know this can easily be destructive but I just can't watch the person I love, suffer.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
When I found out about their problems at early stage of relationship I didn't back out, even though I could if I was selfish. Im a helper by nature and the feeling of happiness I feel around people in need, even just temporal (which usually is), is my soul food. This is the only thing that keeps me going right now. Still things are repeating similar way between us like with my last girlfriend. She can't even wash her clothes at home without her mom yelling and beating her psychologically. She can rarely go out at the age of 24! Her parents obviously don't know about me, yet I presented her to my whole family. She's at college and having highest grades possible, but her parents don't care. I help her all the time too. Hours and hours of projects almost every day. This time I know I really did all I could. I even brought her food many times when she couldn't even cook because of her mom (even though she didn't ask me to), I offered her constant financial support, with no need of money return, all the little things and excitements just to see her smile and joy by my side, yet she feels burdened with debt even though I'm telling her all the time it's my choice and love to her that's doing this.. At the same time I was the miser to my own self with everything and now becoming a ticking time bomb of negetivity due to reality of being stuck at the same point after so much effort put. I'm losing the grip and sinking my love life at the same time. I also know I can't be happy without someone to love and journey through life.	1	2	3	2	1	0	1					2

Even though I am in a better place, I still suffer from depression and the smallest thing can set it off. I still have bouts of uncontrollable crying, still haven’t slept in years and still unsettled and go over different plans in my head to pack up and escape. My partner tells me he loves me all the time, which is reassuring, but also trapping. I do not like myself and really don’t seem to like many other people. That’s probably due to mistrust and my constant negativity that consumes me.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Yes, I am aware of how negative thoughts consuming oneself is very destructive, but that is part of depression and this is what many people battle with and feel that they are not in control and try very hard to regain some happiness. I am also very aware that my depressive negative feelings infects other people and that is why cutting out the cancer is seen as a humane way to go to release the burden on others.

Please don’t think i i’m blaming them, they are all good people and they are my friends and loved ones, it’s just that is their honest assessment of me and i agree with them, they are absolutely correct.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
i did try about a year ago to mention it too her, but i can’t bring myself to form the words, when i try i just get overwhelmed with a feeling that i’m complaining over nothing, and instead take it back and minimize it as much as possible. So when i did that she didn’t pick up on the original request which is totally reasonable, she was busy and i really didn’t say anything. i can’t see another attempt being any more successful.	3	2	1	2	1	0	1					2	
I do know that depression is an illness and can strike anyone, i’m just not sure that it’s necessarily the case with me, i suspect that i’m just too weak to survive. If i’d been born into almost any other time or circumstance when survival was hard, i would never have got to this age, it’s only because life is so easy now that i haven’t died due to my own laziness or stupidity.	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667	
i’m not talking about suicide anywhere but here because i don’t want to make the proverbial “cry for help”, i’m not looking for help,i’m just … done. if i were younger i’d agree with you that i should stick around and things would get better, that is exactly what i did when i was a teenager, and it got me to here. But now i’m 52, there is not much chance at all of anything improving significantly and i realize that it wouldn’t have been a bad thing if i’d done it when i was 17, there’s nothing that i’ve done since then that i look back on and think “well that was worth all the hassle”. the daily grind of living still outweighs everything else in my case.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
As for what i have to lose by trying? i do have something to lose, i lose the chance to not have to experience tomorrow. i don’t know how to make someone understand how much i want to just stop. Stop getting up in the morning, stop dealing with people, stop having responsibilities, stop everything. i’ve been putting it off for years, now i don’t want to put it off anymore. you ask if i want to be a statistic as if the answer is obvious and clear, yet my answer is the opposite you expect, YES! i want to be nothing more than a statistic that sounds like the best possible thing to me, and i don’t think it’s a particularly sad one, millions of people die every day, one more makes no difference in the world.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

"I've never replied to any of these but when I read yours I felt like I was reading exactly what I would have written. Even your replies were identical - right down to researching HFAS - just out of interest. I'm sorry if I step on toes; I'm actually just blurbing my thoughts after reading your post as a way of processing my own thoughts really. I'm always open to learning new things but I always end up at the same pointless reasoning you speak about. I have tried talking to people and therapists and whenever I get to the topic of the point of life no one seems to prove to me otherwise that life is inevitably pointless. I would love to just slink into the background and disappear, preferably in a way that doesn't hurt my bf, family or friends. I have also felt like a type of burden on them. I also have the exact same cycle with jobs, friends etc. I tried medication with the exact same result. I took myself off them after awhile. And I'm in this state for absolute no reason at all; well no conventional reason any way.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
The thing that caught my attention though about your post was your people-pleasing habit. I feel like the ""reason"" may actually lie in that habit. I have the exact same thing; the easy-going casual confidence. I actually let myself go for so long at one point that I got chronic fatigue and ended up in a nursing home for 3 months because i was physcially so tired. After i recovered I thought it was caused by my lack of personal boundaries and inability to say no to people always needing me (which is a people-pleasing trait) but years later i realise that its deeper than that. People pleasing is the cause for all this depression and pointlessness (however, not the root cause)	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Think about it, I know you will because, like me, we over-think everything. It's why we are so good at people pleasing. When you think so much, you're fully aware of other people's needs at all times so you get good at knowing what the ""right thing"" is to say or portray and everybody loves the 'cool, calm and collected folk'. This all gets very tiring for people like us though because essentially that is not who you are in essence. (I'm actually quite socially anxious, I get panicky over small things etc) Everytime you do that you're pushing yourself down to please others. (I do seem to find happiness in pleasing others but this is temporary and tiring and feeding a habit). Finding out the real reason for why you do that is key to possibly lessening the depression. I think the reasons differ for each individual. Whether it be self-worth issues, lack of confidence, learnt behaviour from parents/society, habitual/addictive behaviour. (those are the root-causes) Why do you like to people-please? What is the real reason. I think we know all these answers when we're honest deep-down but if not, the answers uncover themselves when we ask ourselves these questions repeatedly.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
Life is pointless when you're not living it the way you want to be or living it the way that feeds you and stimulates you appropriately. Living life for everyone else is incredibly tiring leaving you with no energy to be bothered to live life for you. You're literally not fulfilling yourself..leaving yourself empty, without purpose...aka: pointless.	3	0	0	1	2	1	1	INVALID			2	2	
Knowing the root causes for why you people-please might give you an indication of what behaviours you need to change to ease the depression/negative thinking. Now, the problem I have with this is: ""ok that's the reason/diagnosis/definition etc etc but what if this habit of people-pleasing and way of thinking is so ingrained that this pointless perspective I have is just who I really am?"" Then what? This kinda thinking is actually just rooted in the fact that I just over-think too much and it is in this instance that it is not serving me, it's not fulfilling me and if i want to get better then I have to stop that kind of thinking. If a habit is not serving you, stop and do the opposite. Obviously that's said easier than actually being done. I am a thinker and with that I can reason anything to make logical sense and I am in need of being constantly stimulated. (It sounds like you have the same ability which can also be our own 'disability'?) I can rationalise anything and anything results in pointlessness. And if that type of thinking is who I am then I need to accept it but not let it limit me.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
But at the end of the day..these are all layers that need to be realised and then peeled back over time. For me, the severe lack of confidence, comparing myself to others with a perfectionist/idealist view and lacking pupose is what drives me to people-please and also makes me feel like a burden on others and ultimately feel like there is no point to life.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
I think there are a few small-impact but effective steps to take that will slowly adjust your thinking that you're being a burden to others, depression & physical/mental tiredness. Eat well, sleep well and excercise. take natural seratonin. This is not the solution but it helps in the background while you're sorting out the more important issues. It's impossible to feel the way you do without reason. There has to be a reason. Yours is not the conventional reason of PTS, loss, finance, family disruption etc. Your reason will be something else that you have to ask yourself honestly and start fixing and building or healing that part of you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Then to help the mental stimulation; do something that makes you and only you feel good on the inside. Keep yourself positively stimulated, do things that you'll be good at. It builds confidence and purpose over time. Usually helping others does the trick. or researching the things that genuinly interest you. Find activities that direct your over-thinking to something that's more productive for you. Surround yourself with people who think/talk like you that support you and build you back up. In this process you'll find who you are again, find that person that has been supressed in the process of people-pleasing. Surround yourself only with people who know that you lack self-confidence so they can build you up. Life is about relationships after all. (showing my bf how anxious i really was as a person was such a relief because he responded with ""i already know that's who you are, tell me how I can help you"" So instead of people-pleasing and connecting with everyone else on their level rather do things that re-connect yourself to you. You're tired because you've depleted yourself, put yourself down by saying you are a burden to others, said yes to others and no to yourself...that is tiring and so you need help to re-build youself up. live a fulfilling life like how you want it.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
I hope that helps in someway. Your post has helped me realise a few things and reminded me that I'm doing the right thing for me at this point in my life..and I mean this in the most unselfish way but more of a survival and self-sustaining kinda way. Don't let yourself get so physically tired like i did, Chronic fatigue took 2 years of my life to recover. Re-energise slowly by making a few minor adjustments to thought processes and self-fulfillment.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

p.s. From personal experience only: admitting you are depressed for no apparent reason helps and start the journey of finding the reason that has caused it. One is depressed because they have suppressed oneself and not fulfilled one's true self-expression. I don't think this requires meds but just incorportaing more self-expression rather than self-depression. Find ways to build up that confidence	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Everyone who has/had depression managed to travell to a place where they can give so much for noting, like working abroad in sunshine country, the rewards are amazing, take off time from work, Sabatical leave for a year to travell the world, if you can't affored to do that, work for NGO in Africa, South Amarica, India, the list goes on, there will be ajustment needed but its so much exciting to see the world and help others, if you don't like it you can come back, few people I know in my family benefit from this things, now most us help and get paid to do what we love to do, the depresson or been unhappy life style here in Western country is for a reason.

Cant get my head around why anyone would create a body so complicated ,its to much of a struggle. must say learned a lot through negative experience,and had some happy times.

How it resonated with me, you have put into words what I have felt for years but have never been able to fully express to anyone (family and freinds just don't seem to get it). It's not to say that I'm never happy or that I am miserable all day every day, those fleeting ""happy moments"" do grace me with their presence now and again, my problem is that I feel undeserving of being happy. I push the people that care for me away (the whole being a burden aspect) and in my experience there is ultimately going to be some or other disappointment and I am not emotionally equipped to deal with constant disappointments. I am not an emotional person, no typical tears and break downs... Instead, I bottle EVERYTHING up, push people away and end up hurting the ones that care for me (my family, friends, ex-boyfriends), I've become a bit of a loner because I feel I don't want to pull other people into the silent mess I feel I have become.

The past couple of months I have been going out with friends, trying to get some semblance of ""normality"" back and on a handful of those occassions I ended up having a bit too much to drink.

Life is not the meaning of knowing how perfect any human being could be. We all are imperfect being by default. Some became more imperfect by trying to fix the problem of one's own life . Where as some are suffering to find solution for other. Life cannot teach a single person to be perfect through man made 7 tips to be perfect. Therefore, I believe that this world itself is imperfect, and no human being who is from down can fix the problem of this world. Every person is searching or seeking some one to fix one's own life problem. In nutshell how can we be happy, Happy is not to withdraw oneself from the norms of the life or to withdraw from the society. Read new/old literature you will find that people thought to be become perfect. But honesty is no one is too perfect to make some body perfect being. But the truth is no one can find the answers of all the problems of the earth. So seek the wisdom from above and look into the whole humanity, I tell you no person from the earth could fix his/her problem. But donot be disappointed and depraved by isolating yourself from the whole community. But look up and find there is only one who came from up can fix the problem of your innerbeing becasue he came from above and can live within you. If you search that truth from the bottom of your heart. He is quite near to you and lives within you. I am talking about the truth that can set you free.Why you are suffering and not seeking the help from above.Once the strength and wisdom is poured to you from above, only then you will find the resourecs from within the world system.... medication, professional health. Don't look for the friends of Job. Go into the society and find any person who loved are is still living who is/was 100% perfect. My personal proposal for you is first seek within yourself, know yourself and look for the one whose name is above all names.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

It's hard to please everyone and even if u can they can never get the true purpose of why. Respect honor friendship with no judgement on talk and being out going .i have lost a lot of things in life big house nice trucks properties .

I lost my nephew to hit n run driver at same time as my divorce and I have never recover from either really . But my depression or whatever it is keeps me in solitude I want no contact with anymore people than I have to , and it is sad because I love most people and look for honor and respect . Maybe to much sometimes , these feelings have been with me for as long as I can remember even as a teenager and they have become out of control I would say now that I am older .

There were certain conditions being met in all of those circumstances, not all at once or in any particular order but those conditions were as follows.	3	4	3	3.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					3.333333333

3. Doing something that has lasting positive benifeits and effects on my own living conditions or those of someone I care about.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
4. Doing something new and challenging that I beleive will lead to tangible positive effects for myself and or others.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
After analyizing these conditions for happyness in me I realized that these are the things that human beings are meant to do. We are meant to seek personal or familial enrichment through hard work and adventure seeking. In the days of our ancestors when the work that you did gave a direct result of how good your life was it was easy to find fulfillment. When we were able to strike out into the world and make it as we saw fit with our own 2 hands and imaginations for ourselvs and our loved ones we were fulfilling our purpose and thus had no reason to be depressed. It is this modern societal construct that is failing us, Human beings were not meant to live in this way! We were not meant to be shackled by any rules, laws and obligations that we did not choose for ourselves! I want to point at a horizon and go as far and as fast as i can in that direction then settle down any damn place i please to nurture myself and my family! I want to learn about anything that takes my interest simply by watching/listening and trying! That is the freedom we are meant to have and THAT is the only way of life that will make a healthy human being! Untill these great societies of ours recognizes these basic human needs whe will continue to circle the drain and more and more people will grow ravenous as these needs continue to go unsatisfied untill eventually it will all collapse in chaos and people are FORCED to live in those ways simply to survive and to rebuild, just like our ancestors.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I've gone deeper in my faith and committed to going to church every Sunday with my Mom and older sister and have been doing so for about a year and a half - a major feat as I'm not one of those disciplined folk at all though I've made a decision to treat it like I treat my job, get up and go despite your feelings and desire to sleep in - it always ends up being beyond rewarding and incredibly uplifting.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3

"It's very sad reading all these comments. I hope you all get better and find happiness. You all deserve it too. I'm in the same situation but I have good reason. Everything is against me. It's not only the depression, the nervous breakdowns, GAD, Agoraphobia, Social Phobia, Social Anxiety, PTSD. I suspect BPD too. All the problems I have revolve around people and me. How can I live when I can't even be near anyone?Even my own family which hurts me. I wish I had a career, etc. Everything everyone does but instead I'm stuck in my house letting the time pass me by. Just wasting time I shouldn't think about it so much I don't have anything to lose. All my problems have caused my misery since I was 4. I don't have a furture. I don't want a present either. I want my pain to go away. I want to be like everyone else. Functional and social. Useful. But instead I'm stuck in my bed I no longer get out of it. I'm all day in it.

It's not like I want to die...quite frankly it's a bit terrifying, but I do want mental peace. Instead of picturing me taking my own life I kind of just picture myself hanging in space orbiting around my own planet. Idk, I look pretty normal and plain but I am a really odd bird. I Think about what people must have done in previous times when life was a lot more simple, but perhaps they were more happy because they just kept busy and they didn't have the option to sit and mope. I really like tv because it's distracting. I finally did something to help me with my drive to become someone, but its probably going to fail.....and then what??? I never ever wanted self-worth before.. I kind of just accepted myself for who I was, pretty much a plain old nobody. But now I'm trying to better my situation and what if that goes wrong..I'm back to being a plain old nobody. I don't know where to focus or emphasize importance. I have been souls searching since I was 10 really and I like myself..i think I could be nicer to family, but other then that I am okay with being a hater and for not keeping up with the Kardashians. I try to find solace in nature, but a storms always a brewing. I often say to myself, ""okay make the most of any situation and your here now so may as well enjoy yourself bc no one is going to make you happy except you and you have one life."" That's kind of my mantra, and also very true, bc often people make me very sad...especially the ones closest to me. Anything can help.. Butler? Any words?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

"Hey there. There is no proper solution to this as such but I believe that it is your thought process which needs change. You should talk about your problem to someone close to you or maybe vent it out by writing or engaging into some activity which requires expressing oneself such as acting or singing etc. It is good that you understand that life ahead is going to be beautiful, but what you also need to have at the moment is patience and don't lose hope.

Sometimes I want to sleep forever, other days I feel better but it's still there in the back of my mind at all times.

It's beautiful that we all post comments here and share our experiences. You wrote that you feel very similar to poster and I very much do as well. I have friends that I used to do stuff with (hiking. Camping etc. ) I just don't anymore. Sometimes looking someone I know in the eye I can sense that they feel I'm not my old energetic outgoing self and I don't know how to change it. I tell a friend or two I can trust that I'm not feeling great, and I always hear basically to suck it up. I don't know how many people on here have constant repetitive thoughts , but I'm tired of it. The only relief is work since I need to focus , but I'm not feeling myself at all. I'm just treading water. I don't want to be here in this place. I own my own home outright. Very very little debt.

You have kids, always a reason to carry on. I'd never have kids because of that responsibility but if you have kids you owe them to fight. My partner might well be able to find someone better, but your kids will never get a new Dad. I think other family are different; you don't have a responsibility to them but kids you do.

I am a ghost, a shell. I no longer know who I am, or care for that matter. I exist in the world as an observer. I am neither happy, nor sad, I just am. I am talented, yet derive no enjoyment from my skills. I don’t like people, and hate to engage in shallow small talk. I have an amazing gf, a kind and loving soul that works tirelessly to help me see the bright side of life, and I do try. She is such an inspiration to me, I wish I could be just like her, but alas, I am confined to a bland existence in my own mind. I feel my life ended some time ago, yet my body persists. I don’t indulge in drugs or alcohol, exercise, seek help with physical and mental issues, yet deep down there is a deep rooted belief that everything is pointless. I have taken the maximum dosage of my antidepressants for over 5 years now, and feel that how things are now is as good as it gets for me. I role play my way through my job, and my relationships, but when the masks come off, and the curtain goes down I am blank, emotionless, and lonely.

Knowing how futile and inappropriate it is dishing out advice - the best I can offer is an ear to listen that understands completely. Most days I feel hopeless, joy is elusive though the best moments usually arrive when I'm with family - I'm only truly close with my immediate family and a few of my cousins who've known me since we were kids. I have never been able to hold on to any friendships for longer than it was convenient for the other person, perhaps I came across as distant too.

A quote apparently not by Mark Twain, but traced to a passage from a book by Anita Canfield entitled, 'A Woman & Her Self-Esteem'"Ask yourself a most profound question: “What are the two most important days in my life?” THE DAY YOU WERE BORN and THE DAY YOU REALIZE WHY YOU WERE BORN!

You seem like a really nice caring person and I can relate to what you say almost completely and especially the ""everything is pointless"" and ""my life ended some time ago"". I personally don't enjoy life like I feel I should I haven't really since I was 16 now 30 and I when really young subconsciously told myself as weird as it is that how happy I was as a kid is not going to last and that i feel i am going to die young anyway. (Surprised I am still alive tbh ) Anyway I feel we all have our paths pre set in life (Fate ) if you want to call it that and you can't change that but on this path we have 2 or possibly more directions given to us and this new direction takes up a portion of our lives until the next directions are given to us and what direction you choose to take doesn't matter meaning that if you choose to look after number 1 you'll get what you want from life but doing so you have to cut things out or people who you want to make happy or you feel obligated to help. The next direction is the opposite of what I said earlier the final one is give up and either stay on the path what your on and do nothing.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3

I read your story with both understanding and sadness, having that same underlying and constant feeling that I long to be free of this life. It's not always been me though, I was a person with drive, leaving home at 16 and moving with conviction and belief that I could make a difference - I was a glass half full girl. I was the one throwing out all those verses that now drive me crazy, thinking, if they knew this pain, they wouldn't be saying, ""pull yourself together"", ""look at the bright side - You're smart, fit, ok looking and married"", or ""look at all who are worse off"". Truth is I don't know when or how my spirit just one day died, my will to get up every morning and have hope, to believe in myself and that I would ever have joy again, all just sizzled up. I forgave my husband for his 2 year affair with a sexy Cuban, it's not that, he stayed with me through it. I know I can work, and have lots of potential, but I can't even finish my writing jobs. When I go home to Australia or travel somewhere else in the world, and am in a safe environment with people who love me, I get a sneak glimpse into the Sally that could be, but I come home and it all falls to pieces. I wish I could say I know it gets better. I'm still hoping God will save me, that in some way I am going through a life lesson, and that I need to be totally cleaned of all that is me (all that I have come to believe is a burden on others and unappealing) and start over as a brand new person. I know God can do it, as I sure can't and that is the hope that keeps me going. I can't see myself having the power to solve this, and I get quite upset when my husband tries to fix me with his superficial niceness. I feel like a face a long long fence, too high to climb, too deep to dig under, and no doors as far as the eyes can see. Or like I""m playing a game of solitaire, and no matter how hard I try I know it's a no win.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
So, in answer, in the end all we have is God. I long to see him and be in that glory, but I don't want to go there feeling like I have let him down and missed the opportunity to share what is good in me ( I know there must be something), to help even just one person, bring a smile to someone. Thanks for sharing openly and allowing all us others the safety and freedom to share our own path and support each other.	2	0	0	0.6666666667	1.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667					0.6666666667

I’m gobsmacked! I can relate to this 100%. Socially awkward to a degree...I can get jobs (nurse NHS) but I always get involved in things that don’t concern me and....I usually leave. I’m plagued by bad decision making, regret etc etc. I no longer have friends, not a single one, my life is inside these four walls.i feel bad for those who die young or suddenly and here’s me not wanting to be here anymore. I’ll never grow old, I know that for sure. But I’m biding my time and making sure ‘things’ are in place. I don’t need or want sympathy, I’m past that....There’s a kind of .... peace when ‘you know’.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

That peace to which you refer is as beautiful as it is scary. It is something you can never tell anyone about or they will think you have lost your mind. It is so deeply rooted, you can't grasp it's source, how it suddenly replace emotion, hope, love, joy. If you told anyone in healthcare, you'd be put in a padded cell to protect yourself and that is terrifying because we are not crazy. I have always been a writer, able to express my feelings, in poetry particularly, but now I grasp with this peace to leave - I watch people living their lives with wonder, see them see me as a successful human being, and am bewildered. I do hope you, and I, grow old, that we can find the source of this evil peace, of this thing that has stolen our will to live or to try. I pray I will wake up and be a new person, I even pray something will happen to me, shake me into reality. I will pray for you too.	2	2	3	2.333333333	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					2.333333333	
So true...thanks for the reply. The peace continues and I even smiled today, I know right...wow and I ventured outside! But I’m not stupid I’ve been here many times before and I’m still clinging on..for now. I’m also glad there are people just like me, who think and see the world from ’our’ perspective and people who, unlike me, can put it into words so elequently like you’re able to.

Hi I totally get the peace thing as I have held it as my comfort blanket for many years now. What I always have done though is hold off making that decision by deciding every morning that today wouldn't be the day I would do it. I have held it off now for around 35 years. I was convinced I wouldn't make old bones either, but you know what I have - yes I am gobsmacked but there is a certain satisfaction to be found from that.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1	
I faced a stark choice in my late 20's but chose to do everything in my power to make my life more to my liking - after all I had nothing to lose did I? The other was my comfort blanket which gave me the confidence to try and sort my life out if you see what I mean.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
I decided I wanted to learn how to make friends (this had totally bypassed me before) so I watched other people, how they interacted and how they talked and behaved towards each other and started copying them adapting it of course to my own personality. At the same time I sought counselling. Well I learnt and started making friends. Then life just opened up for me and so many good things happened ie going to Uni, buying my first home etc. through to discovering a couple of passions which I still have in my life.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
Funnily enough the more I learned the more I knew about myself and the less I wanted to take my own life. I am mainly glad I stuck around otherwise I would have missed some interesting times.

Hey. Ok - so first this is weird. My own Google search of despair has lead me here, to your post dated 3 years a go but currently relatable and compelling me to reply. I see many others felt the same and I'm glad to see your still alive even though I support anyones decision to do as they please with their lives. Whats made you hold on? Or rather how do you just live with it? Freud argued we have life and death instincts. What if some of us just woukd rather not be here? I resent having to think about my family and loved ones etc... they are not really here to support and understand now so why should i stay alive just to suit others? To stop their pain. What about my pain? I find life exhausting. So exhausting. I'd like to sleep now. I'd love for there to be a land of utopia where I could reside but unfortunately as with life there are no guarantees.	4	3	4	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					3.666666667	
I think it's cool you're able to hold down a relationship. I never could. I've always had this feeling that I'm not meant for this world. And that's OK. Surely not everyone is.

I don't know. Even i think im talking s**t sometimes. I've been on meds for about a year.

I wish i never, ever started them. Working out use to be my thing and it helps me loads but doc convinced me i needed to go on meds and now its like i cant get off them. Withdrawal was always so bad i had to go back on them. I hate the word 'suicide' as its connotations are brutal, negative, selfishness and 'crazy'. What if we are the 'normal' ones.

First, I need to say thank you for your candid post. It truly is too bad such conversation is not valued and freely discussed with true support given in the family, in school, in the workplace and so forth but there is a time and place for all things. This forum, your words, gave voice to my feelings. I cherish and am nourished by such discussions! Instead of accepting one another as we are people want to fix us with medication or heap more stress on us by pushing us to leave our comfort zone and follow our dreams, goals and ambitions! Cast caution to the wind, risk your life, do what you have to to get ahead! I've been told I'm too nice as though it is a negative. I've felt crushed and inadequate by constructive feedback, advice and suggestions. I quit my job 6 years ago (retail shift manager)because of severe anxiety. I loved helping customers but was not leadership material. I am uneducated by the world's standards but I understand things pretty clearly. i have difficulty expressing myself which is very frustrating. My brain glitches and for the most part seems empty. I cant carry on a conversation because i dont seem to have many thoughts. I feel confused, drained, unworthy and stupid. Ive wanted to ""leave"" everyday for 15 years. I am clinically depressed and so are millions of other people. Ive analyzed and picked apart everything said to me and everything I've said to others. I've felt like a burden to my husband. Do I think my family will be better off without me? Not anymore but I used to. What helps me? Knowing that the way the world is set up is not conducive to good mental or physical health. Knowing that mankind as a whole is flawed. I feel unworthy and inadequate because I am... and so is every human. I know you have your views on religion and it's understandable because it has failed to do what it's designed to do which is to direct mankind to the true God. The hypocrisy, greed and complete disregard for what God wants has resulted in as you say the blind leading the blind. The most intelligent men on earth (scientists, doctors, engineers, lawyers, professors, political and relgious leaders, etc) have been unable to solve the very basic problems of mankind ie; wars, crime, violence, poverty, homelessness, hopelessness, disease, corruption, drug addiction, the list goes on endlessly. Its no wonder depression has increased by leaps and bounds.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I think religion plays a major role in mental health i tried to work out from the very beginning why this is affecting me tracing it all back and realised that i was brainwashed. I sometimes would rather not have known or rather not been told about God and whilst i believe there must be i'd have rather worked this out myself if i was ever going to. I have honestly thought about suing over this but i'd have more chance of winning the lottery. I asked my mother why i was put in a catholic school she replied because i was and whilst this made me angry because it was the exact answer i was dreading but expecting i don't blame her as i don't think a lot of people understand how it can negatively affect someones mental health.	5	0	5	3.333333333	1.666666667	3.333333333	1.666666667		INVALID			3.333333333	
I agree that religion in the wrong hands is oppressive and can do much damage psychologically. Many have used religious books, traditions and institutions to dominate, harm and deceive others. I must admit that I tried to use the bible to get my family to do things my way on occassion,....It backfired! I've learned that the bible is a mirror for me to change me and only me. I am not suppose to read it with the hope of changing others. I can share what helps me but ultimately their life is their choice. God gave each person free will to choose whether we serve him or not. No one but God should judge our decision. Actually Jehovah God has given Jesus the authority to judge but I digress. : )	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I was moved by your saying you don't blame your mom, even though what she said made you angry. No mom or dad would knowingly put their children in harms way. We really hope and believe we are doing what's best. Unfortunately most of what we know is taught to us by another imperfect human so results may vary.... Let God be found true though every man a liar. The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I can very much appreciate how you feel rsjg. I have a full-life with wonderful children grand kids, a wonderful job and a strength that has gotten me through most anything. But I'm very tired of being here too!!! And I am not depressed!!! And no one will convince me that I am. Drugs are not the answer. I just don't see the point anymore and that doesn't make me sick. I would never do anything to harm myself, but I'm just so done with this place. The bottom line for me is I'm very bored and alone. Mostly alone. I have hobbies that keep me sane. But I never thought I'd be alone this long after a horribly abusive 25 year marriage. I search the web often and ask Google, ""What do I do with the rest of my life?"" like I'm going to find some miracle cure for this life. But I happened upon this thread and just wanted to say Hi!

In my opinion, you are just responding to the accumulative effects of life (it's okay to blame life). Nearly all of us feel this way at times. Why else do you think that so many people have responded to your post? What we all have in common is the ""human condition"". But it's the way that you've described this state of depression...no one else has articulated it so well.	2	2	3	2.333333333	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					2.333333333

You also mention eventually becoming a burden to your girlfriend. Okay, that might be true. But have you considered why your girlfriend is spending her life with you? It's quite possible that she sees the same qualities in you that I (and possibly others on this board) see. Meaning, you add value to her life too. If not, she would be just another friend who has distanced themselves from you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I came across something called Childhood Emotional Neglect on the internet a couple of years ago and it immediately clicked for me. It is something which until now has been virtually ignored by mental health experts but is gathering pace now. It's to do with never learning to experience and deal with our emotions through a healthy and nurturing environment. Because of this we dampen down our emotions in order to survive then either have great problems learning to reconnect with them or are unable to completely.	5	2	3	3.333333333	1.666666667	1.333333333	0.3333333333					3.333333333	
According to CEN emotions are what connect us to ourselves and lead us to have a rich and fulfilling emotional life. The good news is you can to some extent teach yourself how to reconnect and I am doing this right now. Have a look at this and see if it can help you. I hope so.	1	1	1	1	0	0	0					1

Thanks hypercat. Really useful link. I think I experienced one or more of those things from my parents. They were both single children born in the Thirties from very traditional backgrounds and would have no access to the information we have today. I cannot blame them but have never had a close relationship with them. Interestingly my sister rebelled and was a bit wild and I sort of crumpled and shut down. She has a much wider life than me now with children and a partner, whereas I keep myself to myself more but we both have suffered with a depressive outlook and suicidal thoughts. Dunno about her as we aren't close (surprise) but mine continue. Just started really addressing things now, so thanks again for your help.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
You are very welcome Chris. It always puzzled me why I had depression from childhood and have problems in relationships. I wasn't beaten or abused etc so I couldn't fathom it.

Hi to all who post here and to rsjg who started this. Thank you for giving me this window to connect through. The lack of instruction on what to do is refreshing. And also important. My internal response is always, “don't tell me what to do about this, you don't understand”. Contradictorially (is that a word? Looks like one!)

I tend to push people away subconsciously. Unfortunately there are answers to this but my experience shows me that we will not keep it up. There are lots of answers but the only true answer is to accept who we are. Don't worry what everyone else thinks. Be grateful for what we have. Help others. If we do all that and keep it real we will be in a good place. Life is a journey, there is only one destination. So we have to enjoy the journey or change our mode of transport. I have tried a lot of fairly objective self analysis in a 12 step recovery programme (the addiction was not the problem, it was me) and I understand a lot of my problems and character flaws. But ultimately I will disconnect and look for negatives without some serious work, which I get tired of quickly. There is a lot of bad stuff in the world, our society seems to be fixated on wealth and not well being. There are some who think they are the same. We may disagree I think. On the other hand there are some who give and do wonderful things just naturally, I am not one of them, but i do try when I can despite my lack of altruism in doing it.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
That is not to say hope can't creep in. We would not have carried on if we didn't allow hope at all. But hope seems to be easily crushed by our doubts and fears and apathy. The French have the word 'ennui' which seems to be the exact thing I suffer from. Tired of life. I have tried it the way other people do it, I have tried it my way, I have tried to balance them both and have achieved fleeting satisfaction but it is not sustainable for me. I revert to Default. Even as a child I remember responding to my parents with “can't be bothered”. After 58 years I am tired, I have several health issues and few friends, I thank God for a good day each day but cringe inwardly as I don't really feel that it was. Why do it then? Because there is still a little bit of hope. I try to run through the things which were ok and ask for help to do better tomorrow. It keeps me going.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I am not a great supporter of medication for this. All medication if taken in sufficient quantity to be effective is likely to have side effects. And this problem is so fundamental to us and such a product of our thinking that taking a pill does not seem realistic. Only my experience but I was totally unable to explain myself to a professional, I kept making things up and saying what I thought he wanted to hear.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
Thanks to hypercat for mentioning CEN, I am sure it is something that has contributed to my problem but I am not keen on labels. It is too easy to say I am this or I am that, you must make me better. What is the point of a label with out effective treatment and a solution. At the end of the day 'it is what it is' and 'we are who we are'. I think we all react differently to life's difficulties some fight some run some just struggle. I endure, that is the truth and I hate saying it but accept it. From there I can move on. Probably to nowhere but hey-ho!	2	2	2	2	0	0	0					2

This is such an excellent comment, I also feel that rsjg posts have resounded so well across so many people and I'm one of them. Like you said all the posts here allow me to see that there are many who also have felt so tired of life despite unable to pinpoint a real dramatic event that has occurred in their life, furthermore there isn't a lot of comment on ""you should do this"", it's just a community telling one another about their story and how they feel, filled with all the human emotions. For me who also have lost any real purpose and tired of having to wake up to another day for at least 10 years now, I feel like at this point what I want isn't medication but instead someone to connect to. I mean I probably won't find a way to ""cure"" my thoughts but seeing I'm not alone made me just a bit happy, perhaps enough so that I can continue on a bit longer.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

Know that YOU ARE NOT USELESS AND YOU MATTER TO E.V.E.R.Y.O.N.E. Whenever you think that you're not worth it, CHANGE THAT BAD THOUGHT AROUND TO ""I AM WORTH IT!"" Look yourself in the mirror and say ""I. AM. WORTH. IT"" and keep repeating it with emphasis.

There are no easy fixes and no easy words to a depressed individual. To push through day by day min by min is not a easy thing it takes courage determination and a will that refuses eveven thpugh the body is very weak . In most cases as was mine a underline health issue eas the cause. Having pain that puts u in a depressive state but not knowing thats what happened is very dangerous and painfull. Just hang in there it may not get better it might get bearable at best. Having purpose helps . Anything positive helps. But my words will not fix you nor will they ad hope at best you know your not alone and that is something to give support. I may be at the place u were or are. Talking and sharing the road traveled I believe helps. If you can find a group to vent like this where others are going through the same pain at least you know your not alone and we are not just spewing empty words . Our words have substance nutriance and life. They are not spoken from putty or a know it all point of view. our words are of the same dish of pain and suffering. I once heard if we are unable to love a person that has pastaway our sorrow is not of the loss but rather that we are unable to give the love we want to give that causes us sorrow. So in some cases your pain is causes by the fact u just want to love or be loved and have nothing to give and get. That in my opion is a good explanation of pain.

I have been experiencing this for the last few months, I have been searching the web looking for answers.  I am a 45 year old female, in good health, I take no medications, thin, active, I eat healthy, so I am at a loss. I have this feeling like there is something under my right rib cage as if something is stuck underneath or enlarged. At first I thought I had strained a muscle b/c I had been working out in the yard the day before it started. It doesn't hurt, it just feels like there is something there that shouldn't be but when I touch the area there is no swelling or bulge. After about 3-4 weeks when it wasn't going away I went to see my doctor. They did blood work, urine labs and sent me for an ultrasound of gallbladder, all came back normal. I have no other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, etc. just this feeling like something is there. It seemed to go away on it's own and then came back and has come and gone since sometimes lasting a few days, sometimes a few weeks. When it is back wearing a bra is uncomfortable. Sometimes there is a warmth or burning sensation in the area. The only other symptoms I have had that I think are related are these: A few months before this started I experienced a fluttering sensation, almost like when I was pregnant and the baby moved, in the same location, a couple of times. Since this has started, on 3 or 4 different occasions, I have experienced a charlie horse like spasm in the same area, below the right rib, when bending over from a sitting position. Does anyone have any answers as to what this might be?  Does it sound like IBS? Peptic Ulcer?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Sounds like a Hiatus Hernia to me - I have one plus lots of other problems too. I too find wearing a bra very uncomfortable most of the time. Do you suffer from Gastric Reflux? Raising the head end of your bed by about 4 ins helps, as it stops the acid coming back in the night.

Hi there! I think this thread is old but I just saw you posted a couple months back. I've been having the symptoms for several months (feels like something is stuck under my right rib, not much else) Lab work came back fine. Gallbladder checked out perfectly clear, but it turns out I have a lesion on my liver. Getting an MRI next week. I had sudden chest pain in the middle of the night a few days ago but not again since. Have you had anyone look at your liver?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I had a couple lesions on my liver when I went in for an ultra sound and CT scan.....but they said a lot of people do...not to be concerned 🤔, I'm going in for an MRI and a thyroid ultrasound on Friday to find out why I have this bubble feeling under my right rib and now an irratated raspy throat at times....I also have bloating at times....having troubles with constipation.....they said I had a hiatal hernia when they did my colonoscopy and endoscopy, As well as acid reflux but I never had any heartburn until after my tests were done. The Dr put me on Zantac and then Prilosec then I started getting heartburn... So I got off of them and now I get heartburn quite often and it's the type of heartburn that starts in the morning and doesn't go away until I go to bed😣 so I will let you know what the doctors fine on my MRI .....this is very frustrating it's been going on since January😥	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Good luck! Let me know how that MRI goes. I'm hoping mine will also happen this week.

Everything looked normal but they weren't able to diagnose the liver lesion. I am having another MRI in November to see if it changes. They believe the liver lesion is an incidental finding and they do not believe the liver is causing my discomfort. I am seeing a GI doc today and having a pelvic ultrasound tomorrow. They want to rule out things like ovarian cancer, cysts, and endometriosis. I will keep you posted! What did you find out?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hello , I had this problem too. I have a hiatus hernia , could not endure it a second time so I have been taken off the lust for an MRI on my liver . When I had an ultra sound my gall bladder was ok but it revealed a light patch on my liver , hence the MRI referral . I was on Lansoprazole for gastric reflux but haven’t taken it for a week as I hate taking tablets permanently. The reflux hasn’t reoccurred as yet but the under the rib discomfort has!

this is me as well. Started December 13. had a CT and they found nothing so now waiting on HIDA scan for gallbladder. The worst thing for me is if I sit in a car for an extended period. It really aggravates it. Whatever "it" is.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
So many of us have something similar, and no doctor i have seen has been able to figure it out. I have the same problem sitting in a car, especially for longer drives. It helps me to use a small back support pillow--keeps me from slumping	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
Hola Kit, I have a ton of severe stomach issues. I am not a doctor but, I do know that the stomach es actually in the upper left section of the abdomen and the gall bladder es in the upper right section. Although a CT scan has been done and the results came back "ok", it does NOT necessarily mean that everything es perfectly fine with the gall bladder... Not folks that review CT Scans, MRI ' S etc. are skilled... Some doctors may determine that you have "sludge or small gall stones" and not consider it a big deal because medicine claims that the "MAJORITY" of patients have no pain at all... YOU could be in that rare category of folks that have pain. I am no a doctor but, if it does not feel the way that it normally should, there es something going on. Sounds like something in that area may be swelling for whatever reason at times. ...but, the gall bladder can certainly cause those periodic sharp pains... I would definitely obtain a second and possibly a third opinion if necessary. Could be scar tissue... Regardless, do no take it lightly. IFAlso, blood work can be misinterpreted and labs can make mistakes. I certainly will keep you in prayer my friend. 😊	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
your livers in the same area. I would have pains in areas and also feel like something was punching me in rib cage. I was told it was my liver Hardening. since it was struggling. all my results and test came back all my organs were ok. my heart started struggling too. i have a gluten allergy and celiac. it was causing me not to absorb my nutrients. i was severely deficient in iron, d3, Bs ets. for this reason I wasn't creating blood. up until heart doctor who figured it out they kept dismissing and thinking I was losing blood. they weren't listening to me. get checked for deficiencies and allergies. food and internals.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I had problems on and off for a few years, discomfort on my right side, pain most of the time after fatty foods, i had every scan going and was told my gallbladder didnt have stobes in, i continued to have discomfort and i knew it was to do with my gallbladder so i asked for it to be removed where they found it was infected etc, this wouldnt show on any scan, it did solve the problem im glad to say.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I've had several different feelings under the right rib area. I've had gallbladder removed years ago, full hysterectomy. For several years, I feel random light pinch like pains under right rib in the abdomen area, comes and goes, lasts seconds . Other times, it feels like the ribcage itself that's sore, just on the edge, that pain was also intermittent. I thought maybe poor posture? But now not so sure it's posture related. I've also had awful charlie horse/cramps, muscle spasm in right rib cage. But last 2 weeks, I've had both pains and although they come and go, it's lasting. I have diahrea and some mushy stools but doctor say it's likely IBS and because I don't have a gallbladder anymore. I've had bad reflux last year as well. I thought all of these where not related but will go to doctor this week and check it out. Have you had any results?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

This past weekend I noted what I'd describe as an odd pressure/, sorenessnear near the outer edge of my right rib cage about where my bra crosses. I've been stretching out my right side as it feels like a muscle soreness in some aspects. It's not going away and it becomes aggravated after wearing a bra all day.

HI everybody. new to this forum, but been experiencing same issue for over ten years. I've self diagnosed this to an issue with Hepatic Flexure, which is where youre large intestine folds/turns under your liver. also you can suffer on left side (i don't) with splenic flexure, ie the turn of the colon on the left side under the spleen. This is why pain/discomgort comes and goes. I've had every test imaginable and nothing showed anything other than normal with liver, kidney, pancreas, gall bladder was removed and still discomfort persisted.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
i've started excercising area to try and minipulate the colon. Hip rotations on my back, roles on back with knees tucked and generally being more active, with specific focus on squashing, twisting and turning this area. HAS defo hrlped relieve the discomfort. I read that these conditions are life long, but not too serious. Keep this post going, keep sharing exercise routines that help.	4	5	4	4.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					4.333333333

Ur symptoms sound just like mine... they had done blood work on me and it didn't show anything but I kept Complaining that something wasn't right so they sent me for an ultrasound. ... and I am now scheduled for my gall bladder to b removed... I don't know y the blood work didn't show anything but I just had to go with what I was feeling and I knew there was something wrong.... so go with what ur body is telling u ..if it isn't ur gall bladder it could b a hernia, that needs to be taken care of... an ultrasound of the upper body cavity should shed light on ur problem... either way I would ask for more testing....keep us updated... Good luck & God bless J'me	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Found this discussion in searching my symptoms so glad I have found others with similar symptoms. Please keep updating information, I recently found out I was severely hypothyroid.  I had many symptoms over the last two years that I just chalked up to age, I am 40. I finally went in when I felt the bulge under my right rib cage it really scared me.  I have been on generic synthroid for about three months and feel like a new person, but still have that daily bulge!  I feel like a crazy person and just wanted to add maybe what I have was secondary to my thyriod problem incase you had not had your thyriod levels checked.  I have realized I am not dying and will continue to mention the bulge at bloodwork appointments.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Well I just wanted to say, I have been experiencing the same problems. In January of this year I had a severe cold found myself coughing a lot. During this time I started feeling something under my right rib area that shouldn't be there. Although I couldn't feel nothing when I would touch the area.... My stomach bloats out at times and then I get a sensation like cold tingly feeling across my diaphragm area. Also when I eat fruit and instantly begin to swallow, I get a sensation in my lower right area of my stomach. So I went to a doctor, they did an ultrasound on me and found nothing. I went to another doctor he ordered me to go in and get a colonoscopy, and a scope put down my esophagus to check to see what was going on. The gastronologist said I have slight diverticulitis symptoms. I had inflammation in my esophagus, due to a slight chance of food allergies, some erosion in my esophagus and a hiatal hernia. They told me to take Zantac twice a day. They didn't go over diet with me or nothing just threw me pills! I have never had heartburn in my life, so it kind of threw me off that they wanted me to take antacid pills. When I started taking antacids....I started getting heartburn.... so I went to another doctor they did a CT scan, blood work, and took x-rays, and found nothing! So right now I am wondering why I'm taking allergy pills, and now I'm on Prilosec but I'm still having the sensations in my stomach and the feeling under my right rib and no one can help me:-(does anybody have any prognosis as to what the feeling under the right rib could be? Could it be the hiatal hernia off to the right side? One of my doctors says the hiatal hernia would be right directly under your diaphragm.... I feel like a hypochondriac and just want some answers...	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Ask for a HYDASCAN. I went through several months with a pain under my ribs on my right side. Had all the tests mentioned in the string and one I didn't see. There is a test called a hydascan. With this test they found my gallbladder actually had essentially almost stopped working. A week later it was taken out and I was better. So ask for a hydascan if they haven't found anything with the normal tests. Sister and a friend had the same and both only had to suffer for under a month as I recommended the test and they also had theirs removed as they had similar results.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hi I too have a hiatal hernia & have all the same symptoms. Apple Cider Vinegar has definitely helped . I was given Lansoprazole for Reflux but stopped taking it in August . It didn’t return this time . I do find it all quite scary as it really feels look kevthere is something on my right side . I used to get great discomfort & bloating after eating certain things but it has all ceased since taking the vinegar !	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I have the same issue, pain under the right upper rib cage so severe I feel like I'm going to pass out! Went to see GP he said gallbladder most likely had an ultrasound & blood test everything is normal. Later that night I was rushed to the ER for the pain, had CT scan and again normal. Went back to my GP the next day & he admitted me to the hospital, they did a HIDA scan my GB was functioning at 10% so they took it out. The surgeon told my family that the gallbladder looked great once they had it out & he doubts that was the problem. 3 weeks post op & I'm still in the same pain feels like when your pregnant & the babies foot gets stuck in your ribs. I'm so frustrated because now I have more issues nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and not eating. I just had a CT scan with contrast and that came back normal too, I have an upper GI scheduled next week & hoping for answers. I can't sit or bend over without feeling like something is going to burst under my ribs	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Vanessa66568 - have you found out any answers? I’ve described my pain in my ribs the same way - feels like you’re pregnant and the baby’s foot is in your ribs. It first started happening after I had kidney stones and I had to have one removed that was stuck. I’ve been told that my kidneys function normally, but my right kidney is slightly enlarged. I’ve had CT scans, ultrasounds, pelvic ultrasounds, and I don’t have my gallbladder. I’ve also tried the chiropractor. I haven’t had issues since losing 35 lbs until yesterday. Ive been nauseous and vomiting and feel like I have the flu, but after reading this thread I’m thinking it might be something else. I’m curious what you have found out from the other tests you had done.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hi Angie, I found this tread tonight as I lay in bed feeling like an alien is trying to bust out of my right rib cage. I can so relate to most everyone’s symptoms on here but I thought I’d respond to you because yours was the newest post. Your symptoms are so much like mine. It does feel like when I was pregnant and my baby was pushing against my ribs. I also have all the Charlie horse like catches in that area. And tonight I just feel sick. I’ve dealt with this off and on for years but this time it’s lasted for about 3 months with different degrees of pressure. Tonight’s was the worst. My dr did a urine test-normal and liver function test-normal. I go in this Friday February 16th for a Ct scan with contrast. I had my gallbladder out in 1998 so I know it’s not that. I have sjogrens and deal with reflux off and on but usuall my daily prescribed Prilosec takes care of that. But tonight I’ve had heartburn along with all this pressure. So I’m not sure what it is and after reading this whole thread, I don’t feel hopeful I’ll find out. I have been gluten free for years which really helped with stomach issues and reflux. I just recently stopped consuming dairy to see if that would help but so far no. So anyways I’d like to find answers so please keep me updated on how you are doing.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
How did your CT scan go? Did they find anything? I’m currently experiencing the same pain, although I have had my gall bladder removed and was told I have a hiatus hernia last year.

Hi jayde21148, Sorry I didn’t respond right away. The ct scan was normal. Which is great. So after ruling out any visible problems in my gut area, I’m assuming I have IBS. I guess there’s no test for that so they rule out anything else. So after reading forums of people with IBS I see that same complaint on there. Discomfort in the right rib area. At the moment that pressure is gone. It has always come and gone for years but this last time it just lasted for weeks. So now I need to work on my diet to control the symptoms of IBS.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

mine has been a small pinch under right rib where gallblader was but removed several years ago before any of this started. Seemed to happen after drinking too much but it always went away.

Since, the other thing was the charlie horse cramps I feel between ribs, not all the time, but streching got the kinks out. Now I feel like something pressing in there but not all the time.

I was diagnosed with slipped rib syndrome. After trying PT, chiropractic care and injections, I finally had surgery removing two ribs on my right side and one on mt left side. When they went in they found the two on the right side were actually hitting each other - causing inflamation and fluid build up on the right side. I am finally able to sit for longer periods again - go to the movies, take road trips and longer flights! The surgery was in August and I still feel the need to wear a support brace around my ribcage as I am still trying to strengthen the muscles around my rib cage to avoid additional slipped ribs.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Before surgery, I could not lie on my right side, found it difficult to breathe at times, could not sit without swelling and discomfort, could not exercise, had increased inflamation and discomfort when bending over, had the feeling like when I was pregnant and my baby's foot or part of their body would be up in my rib cage. I would recommend seeing a thoracic surgeon, chiropractor, or rib/pain specialist in your area for diagnosis.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I am 52 - had my gall bladder out 15 years ago, had surgery for MALS (Median Articulate Ligament Syndrome) two years ago after I had shingles). The MALS surgery had eliminated the gastrointestinal issues I had, but, not the pain under my right rib cage. Then I was finally diagnosed with Slipped Rib Syndrome by a rib/pain specialist. I had made the mistake of thinking the pain came from under my rib cage when the pain was actually coming from my ribs themselves.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I would suggest looking up Slipped Rib Syndrome and MALS to determine if they describe what you are feeling. Both are very rare and often misdiagnosed. MALS is visible in either a CAT scan or an MRI - I had both and sent all of my results to a specialist - Dr Hsu in CT who does surgery for people all over the world. He can see if you have MALS just from the scan. Slipped Rib Syndrome is trickier - it does not show up in xrays and most scans. sometimes they can determine which ribs are slipped in an ultrasound. My chiropractor was excellent and found which ribs were slipped through multiple visits. she could set them back in place, but, then they would slip back out of place within a few days. Dr Kimberly Krug in New Canaan, CT. I would not recommend the surgeon who performed the rib removal as his follow up care was poor and even after going to him multiple times he missed a staph infection after surgery which delayed the healing process a few months. There is a surgeon who has done multiple Slipped Rib Syndrome surgeries located in Atlanta - Dr Daniel Miller - Wellstar Thoracic Surgery - Marietta, GA. I wish I had gone to him as my surgeon was not as familiar with the surgery.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I have had this charlie horse feeling when i bend down come and go for a couple of years now. It is NOT the gallbladder because i had it out in 2014. I was told I had a fatty liver several times. I do feel bloated when this happens. I am guessing it is a swollen liver, so I will ask dr to ultrasound it. I will keep informing. Thanks everyone!!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I don't know if you're male or female but have you ever considered asking your doctor about a pelvic US? I am having that done tomorrow to rule out some issues down in that area, which can cause pressure and in turn push your organs into your ribs.

Hello, I realize this thread started two years ago, but see no conclusive diagnosis in any of the comments. kit4410  did you ever find out what the problem was?

I've been to my PCP many times, he is being excellent. They found a 1.5cm lesion on my liver but everything else looks normal (unremarkable). The lesion is not likely to be causing the discomfort I'm experiencing.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I had a slightly elevated CA125 blood test result, which my doctor did to test for ovarian cancer. It is not high enough to indicate cancer, but possibly other things, like endometriosis. I am seeing a GI doctor today for the first time and having a pelvic U/S tomorrow to rule out any cysts/growth around there. My doctor said that just because the discomfort is under my ribs doesn't mean the issue is there... it could be pressure from other things below it.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Yesterday I read through most of this thread then it occurred to me, not one of the posts did I see that anyone looked for help from their chiropractor.  I pulled out my own rib cage as best as I could yesterday and woke up with no symptoms.  I did go to my chiropractor today. We'll see if that helps. Good Luck!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hi Cory - I have had all these same systems listed in this thread - only it's on my left side (most on here have stated right side.   Feels like a golf ball under your rib, sometimes like something is hung on my rib.   -I get that flutter feeling sparatically and charlie horses in it too.  After an MRI my doctor told me that it was an inflammation of the intercostal lining (the lining around your ribs). -and what I didn't realize is that there are nerves in the intercostal lining and if that nerve gets inflamed it can be very painful (I chalked it up there along with child birth & kidney stones!-it can get bad!).   They gave me pain meds when it got that bad but what they prescribed was meloxicam -daily (for inflammation) and I continue to take it about a month after the pain subsides.   It seems like it flares up with coughing when I get sick -or over exert in some way - it appears to just be weak in my system but Meloxicam is a simple solution that I start to feel relief with 4 to 5 days!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hi summer - I have this on the left side.  I call it Mr Crab is back.  It flares up.  I have HH/Reflux which I handle ok.  But this awful feeling like a crab is gripping under my left ribs gets me down - it just hangs on tight.  I feel relief only when I lie down in bed, then is disappears.  Defo flares worse when I am anxious.  Intercostal lining sounds interesting and the nerves being affected.  I have noted your meds for my doc. Good input.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hello Jane, why do you think the symptoms are related to alcohol consumption? I am experiencing mostly the same discomfort described in this thread, I do drink regularly and have been told I have a Fatty Liver but my Liver Enzymes are all normal but I have wondered about the alcohol connections as well as the spine miss-alignment that others have mentioned?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I also have the same symptoms as yourself, I have had problems with acessive alcohol use and was diagnosed with a fatty liver also, the main cause of the pain is your pancreas which becomes inflamed due to alcohol a course of antibiotics and laying off-the-wall booze works wonders xx	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hi ana! I want to know your updates. I have endometriosis. This might be the cause of the pain and lump at the back of my lower right rib cage.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
This sure sounds a lot like what I'm going through.  Mine feels like nerve pain like needles most of the time.  Sometimes feels a bit swollen but not too often.  I still have a feeling it's my thoracic rib and back that's doing this but I just don't know.  I may have another ultrasound - been having this off and on for a year and a half.  Does anyone else get needle like pain????  Doesn't seem like gallbladder - I know I don't have stones per last ultrasound.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I don't get any needle like pain, just the same symptoms that kit4410 described. Sounds like several people are experiencing something like this. Wish any of us had a clear diagnosis!	2	2	2	2	0	0	0					2

I get the needle pain. Today it's bad. When I rubbed the area, I felt a hard lump. First time I have felt a lump. Mine feels like its numb with pins and needles. About 2" below center of bottom right ribcage. Had endoscopy, ultrasound, swallowing test, colonoscopy, another test where they inject me with a dye that makes you want to pee. Then they do a CT scan to see if you have any blockages. All my tests came back normal. I am stumped. I am 55, don't drink at all, but do drink a lot of Diet Mountain Dew. Like 5 a day. I am a smoker. Taking Zyban and my quit day is in 8 days. I gained 100 pounds recently. The first 40 I don't know how. My Dr said to go to the gym. There was something wrong and he blew me off. Than I got depressed about the weight gain bc I was anal about what I ate and I worked out twice a day. Was doing 300 crunches a day. And the more I gained, the more depressed I got. So I quit working out, than quit being so anal about what I ate. Now I'm 240 pounds. Was 136 about 3 years ago. But I am stumped about this pain. It is a very wierd sensation. Almost like when the dentist numbs your mouth, and the numbness starts going away. Pins and needles.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
That stinks Mary, I'm sorry! First of all, it sounds like you may need a new doctor.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I first noticed the same sensation (numbness/tingling) while I was pregnant. My OBGYN said it's very common because your abdomen grows and it puts pressure on a muscle that pinches a nerve and causes the numb sensation. I wonder if weight gain is presenting a similar challenge.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I would recommend an MRI. If it helps, I have gone through all the tests and even found benign spots on my liver. When I went to see a liver specialist he said 30 years ago when people had issues like this, they would do exploratory surgery and most usually would find nothing. Unfortunately he said it may just be something we live with, as long as we can rule out the dangerous stuff.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Take care of yourself! Try to join weight watchers and exercise when you feel better. It's a lot easier to lose weight through diet than exercise, and seeing some results may inspire you to work out! And please, try to quit smoking	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Yes!  My thoughts too. I've been adjusted with ribs out of place t11-t12. Plus muscle relaxers when I feel the spasm pain in my rib like something is jammed up in them. I've also had the fluttering feeling, along with pain and severe bloating. My chiro always seems to make it feel much better, until I lift something or pull it back out of place again.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

So last night I was sitting here watching a movie leaning back a bit and I could feel the pressure building and the pain intensifying.... Probably the worst it's ever been.

It seems so bizarre to me that so many of us have similar symptoms, but  very few have had clear diagnosis of the problem. Several of us, including me, have mentioned it feeling like a baby kicking. Are we all females? Wondering if it could be a reproductive organ issue.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
I don't see any correlation with reproductive organs just because they are positioned so low in our pelvic area and the issue is so high up by the diaphragm.

I have the exact symptoms as Kit.  Have had them for 3 years.  Mine started with the fluttering sensation when I would laugh hard or bend over. Then it started feeling tender after eating a large meal, the same as i felt when pregnant like a pressure causing the soreness. But not painful. Now I feel some soreness in my back occasionally on the same right side. I don't really have the fluttering anymore but the past couple of weeks when I twist or bend a certain way  or slouch down the exact same spot will have a burning or stinging sensation that just lasts a few seconds.   I had bloodwork and ultrasound about a year ago and they didn't find anything. I am not overweight but I do have a desk job so I sit alot. I do exercise almost everyday.... walking, treadmill, elliptical and a recumbant bike. I have wondered if it has to do with my posture sitting at desk on computer. I do sort of lean to the right side using the mouse.  Or maybe hormones? I am 50.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I blame a lot of things on meno - i'm 60 and have been suffering with menopause for over 10 yrs.  I try to exercise as much as I can also and my PT person thinks this is scoliosis and bad posture for many yrs.  many yrs at a deskjob also.  I still don't know what I have.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
So I found this thread and want to say I have the same problems and tried talking to my doctor about it, but he said it was nothing.  I just tried to some ab workouts and I feel a tightness and pain as if something is tearing on my right rib.  There almost feels like a constant tightness on the right side.  The doctor checked my gallbladder and liver through ultrasound and found nothing.  I don't know what to do and I want to workout, but not if it will keep causing this pain	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Has anyone found out what’s causing this pressure. I see a lot of us have the same conditions and have had the same test. But has anyone found the relief for it. Planning on gallbladder surgery soon.

Please do not have your gallbladder removed unless you are positive it is non-functioning.  You'll have more problems, if you do.  I have not seen an answer to the issues the people on this forum are having.  I have had it for almost 10 years.  It started as a stabbing pain when I bent over to tie my shoes.  It has now moved on to a terrible muscle spasm that is relieved by standing up as straight as I can and trying to relax.  I definitely believe it is positional (any type of bending wrong at the waist) and I try my best to not do anything that puts me into that position.  I guess you would call it "guarded."  First doctor thought it was a floating rib, the second thought it was my gallbladder.  I'm not sure what it is, other than it's painful.  I now eat better sticking to light meals of fruits, vegetables and lean meat.  I do my best not to overindulge because it worsens the problem, in my experience.  It probably isn't life threatening since I have dealt with it for so long.  Good Luck!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Exactly what I have heard.  Even if it's low functioning best not to have it out unless it's really bad.  I don't want mine out.  I haven't had a hida scan yet.  I still have a feeling this is my thoracic spine - I get pain back there and in ribs in front.  I don't eat a lot of fat either.	3	4	3	3.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					3.333333333

I read spurs can press on nerves.  Everyone tellsme mRI probably won't show any anything.  I have a gastro followup next month but this doesn't seem related to food intake.

So frustrating!! My dr. Thinks I hurt in too many places at random for it to be serious. Shrugs and says "sorry"! I'm 66 and had heart checked, bloodwork. And all was okay. I have some acid reflux according to him, but it is random also. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia several years ago, and he thinks I have costochondritis. When I ask what I can do, I get another shrug! I had been taking vicodin for several years but he has stopped all opiates to his patients due to the US war on opiates. So I get a "sorry"! I didn't think vicodin helped much until I stopped it!lol Over three months now and I found out what pain was!  Anyway, I wonder if anyone has mentioned costo to you??	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
My original DR did say Costo but I knew that was a crap diagnosis when he said it. The pain was not in the correct location and the symptoms didn't fit.

Hi, I came across your post and was wondering if you got any answers? I am a 46 year old female with the same feeling. I know it's not my gallbladder because that was removed over 2 years ago. I was recently diagnosed with celiac artery compression syndrome. I had surgery to fix that and felt better for about 3 weeks. Then the feeling under my rib came back. I've had practically every test known to man and they never show anything. I'm wondering if it may be an epigastric hernia. That's my next thing to check. It feels like when I was in the last months of pregnancy and the baby would put their feet under my ribs. That's the only way I can explain it. Hoping for answers.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I've gone over this problem with my primary care physician, GI doc and my endocrinologist with no answers. My primary doc thinks it's all in my head. He asked if I thought it could be some sort of anxiety. Well I suffer from anxiety/panic attacks and this feels nothing like that. He wanted me to try taking lorazepam once a day to see if it helped. Well guess what. Nope didn't help. So no doc it's not anxiety. I've had this issue since May 2017. It's getting to be very frustrating. How can a person continue to live this way? I hate that others suffer with this same problem but I'm glad to know I'm not alone.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hi, I just got off the phone with my general surgeon that preformed my 2 surgeries last month. I vaguely remember him telling me after the first surgery that he had found a hernia around my stomach and esophagus and that he had repaired it. So for the next 3 weeks I didn't have any of the pain or pressure under my right rib. I thought it was fixed. About 2 days ago the pressure returned just as before, feeling like a baby had their feet underneath my ribs. I called the general surgeon to ask him about the first surgery and if he actually repaired the hernia or just pushed it back in place. They said he "repaired" it. He did say that I have what's called paraesophageal hernia or hiatal hernia. Those most likely could cause the pressure under my rib. He said to give it a few more weeks to see if it resolves and he'll check it when I come in for my next appointment with him. In my opinion whatever he did to repair the hernia did not work and it has returned. I'm not in any pain it's just a lot of pressure and it's very uncomfortable. Just trying to put it out there that maybe you should go to a gastroenterologist and have them do a test for paraesophageal hernia or hiatal hernia. I hope this helps.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hi Kit, Did you find an answer to your symptoms?   For the last several years I have pain under my right rib cage.  I also feel like something is stuck there and have right back and shoulder pain.  The reason I found this thread though is that I was searching for the charlie horse symptom.  I get charlie horse (severe cramping) to the right of my stomach under my rib cage when I bend over.  It stops me in my tracks and I have to do the quick breathing like I'm in labor and wait for it to go away.  It has happened when tying my shoes or relaxing in the bathtub when I sit up to turn the water on or off.  I have had an ultra sound and a CT scan of my gall bladder and Dr says all is normal looking.  The only thing they found was a very small kidney cyst.  If anyone has solved this frustrating issue please let me know.  This morning it woke me up at 2:00 am and I'm just about to get online and request to see my GP.  I'm going to ask to be referred to some kind of internal medicine specialist or something.  I feel like he doesn't know what's causing it so he's letting the ball drop....but I'm getting pretty tired of it.  I don't like the pain or the worry.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Do you vape?   I made a comment asking for the same help or updates on this forum somewhere but I can't find it now to update.  I actually went to urgent care with this pain recently.  Once again they couldn't find anything wrong with my gall bladder, liver, appendix.  On this trip though they told me that I had calcium spots on my pancreas.  After a lot of reading I came across articles on how nicotine (not cigarettes) can cause the pancreas to have too much calcium.  The pancreas can cause pain.  I don't know if links are allowed but here goes.....https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12094008 ;   If I think about it.... the pain started shortly after I started vaping about a year and a half ago.  So then I noticed that there are tons of people on vaping forums that have these symptoms.  Even their doctors are telling them that vaping shouldn't have anything to do with it but I'm not so sure.  It's pretty close to Christmas so I won't see my own Dr. until after.  So I'm going to try to stop vaping and see if the pain goes away.  I love vaping so this isn't going to be fun.  Wishing you all well.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Any updates?  I too am feeling the same symptoms as kit440- I have had an ultra sound which is all clear.  Wondering if I should just chalk this up as a weird symptom that doesn’t mean much or if I should pursue this.  Could the ultra sound of my liver be clear, but there still be an issue, or should I just accept the clear result and have peace of mind?  Any thoughts?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Started on 10mg cit 2 weeks ago have dropped to 5 mg as really racked up anxiety. I seem quite sensitive to meds , intrusive thoughts and anxiety from zopiclone withdrawal, then did mess around bit initially trying cit then swapping to sertraline which gave me OCd then back to cit so could be withdrawal from that. Just wondered if can still recover on low dose as can't tolerate anything too high, and how long I should wait before thinking increasing, all this corona stuff not helping as no social contact.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
This is just my opinion but if the suggested therapeutic dose starts at 20mg then that is the lowest dose that you should be working up to.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
As anxiety is a side effect it's hard to know if the symptoms are of your mental health difficulty or side effects but I've always started on 20mg (albeit with side effects for the first few weeks) and then gone up to 40mg if I'm super bad. HTH. As I said, just my opinion but if 5mg worked then surely the pharmaceutical companies would offer 5mg tablets.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
The maximum i can take is 20 at my age so certainly wouldn't be able to start that high. I started on 5 then when i raised to 10 racked up symptoms then eased when i lowered.

A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to. As it did for several ladies beforehand.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
My reductions are VERY slow. I use the following pattern to reduce each 1mg:	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
1 day new dose, 6 days old dose	5	5	1	3.666666667	1.333333333	1.333333333	2.666666667			INVALID		3.666666667	
By that stage if I feel OK I feel safe to go all new dose. I suppose you might be OK starting and stopping at "1 day new, 4 days old" but I was terribly sensitive to steroid withdrawal pain so I err on the safe side. Once you get to the "everyday new dose" - if you feel OK you can start on the next reduction, no real need to spend a month at the new dose.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
This avoids steroid withdrawal pain - which is so similar to PMR pain that you often can't tell which is which and some of us suspect that many flares are NOT the PMR returning but problems with steroid withdrawal. Using a scheme like this also means you can stop immediately if you have any problems - you might be fine at one day old dose, 2 days new (lower) dose but not at a 3 day gap - but you have dropped your dose a lot and that is the idea. It also isn't as slow as you would think - you can reduce at a rate of about 1mg/month on a continual basis.	4	0	0	1.333333333	2.666666667	1.333333333	1.333333333	INVALID				1.333333333	
The Bristol group start new patients with PMR with 6 weeks 15mg, 6 weeks at 12.5mg and then a year at 10mg before continuing the reduction and that achieves a far lower rate of flare (20% instead of 60%) and I suspect their flares then come below 10mg as they then do the 1mg at a time reduction. Just below 10mg is a common dose for people to get stuck at - and I (and others) believe it is because even 10% drops are too much for many patients. These patients are then labelled as "steroid resistant" or told they need methotrexate to help them reduce but we have seen this slow reduction work for those patients too. We believe that methotrexate (MTX) works for patients who have late onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) or LORA and PMR together. Very few patients get off pred altogether when taking the MTX - those who do are probably the mis-diagnosed LORA patients - or another arthritis that responds to MTX."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

When you are at doses below 5mg it is a good idea to rest at each new dose for a month at least before trying the next reduction. At this point you risk overshooting the dose that is controlling the inflammation so waiting a short time to see if symptoms reappear is helpful. If you just continue there is a possibility that you get to very slightly below the "right dose" and inflammation will start to reappear very slowly. The blood tests will lag even further behind the dose reduction - there must be enough inflammation to increases the proteins being measured for the blood tests to rise.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

My reply was:	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
No - you go back to the last dose that worked well immediately and stop the reduction. This isn't a "flare", this is your body telling you that you have got to the dose you are looking for: the LOWEST DOSE THAT MANAGES THE SYMPTOMS. It doesn't mean you won't get lower, it just means not yet. However slowly you reduce, whatever scheme you use, you will not get below that dose without a return of symptoms because of left-over inflammation that hasn't been removed by the amount of pred you took. It is if you ignore these warnings that you will allow a build-up of the inflammation to the stage where you will have a flare on your hands.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
To comment on something someone else said - you have differentiated between steroid withdrawal and a return of symptoms by using DSNS. If you were going to suffer with steroid withdrawal you will notice it the first day you use the new lower dose. That is the idea of DSNS - you go back to the dose your body is happy at for a few days and then show the new dose to your body again. For me it usually takes about 3 times for my body to accept the new lower dose and stop complaining.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hello Maurice, I too suffer very badly from cramp in my legs when I sit too long or very early in the mornig. It is extremely painful and I have to get up and wiggle my legs and walk about. It certainly makes a very disturbed night. A friend's doctor told her that Zinc if the answer for cramp. And indeed every night now I take  Zinc, Magnesium and potassium. At first it gave me pain free nights for about a month but latterly I've been bothered a bit with the return of cramp, but not as bad as it was. So I suggest you get yourself some zInc and try that. Hopefully it will have the same positive effect. I only hope I'll continue to sleep through the nights without doing my midnight wiggle!!!! I had wondered above Vascillitus!! Hope I spelt that correctly. Also wondered if this cramp In the legs is associated with PMR which the docs believe I have.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hello Maurice, I too suffer from night leg cramps, but have the answer for me. Tonic water every day, 200ml if Fever Tree brand. If I use the cheaper tonic water sold in the big stores I need a good glass full. I understand it's the quinine that does the trick. I've had restful nights for over six months now since trying out the tonic water. It works for me and I would encourage you to try it. I've read it doesn't work for everyone, but I for one, know in the night if I forget to take my glass a day!  Good luck!	4	5	4	4.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					4.333333333

My dad has been dealing with a horrible case of PMR and GCA since last  June, but diagnosed in August.  He started out at at 60 mg... only down to 40 right now.  We've been trying to taper slowly, but his flares are horrible.  The rheumatologists in his area are few and far between and negligent at best.  On the last doc's watch, dad diagnosed with heart failure and then severe osteoporosis, only diagnosed after 5 vertebrae fractures.  I'm trying to figure out if the DSNS approach is how to reduce from such a high dosage or if you do this once you get down lower?  Any advice is appreciated.

Hello ​Ive been on prednisolone for 4 years now Im down to 5mg but struggling to get lower. Am I right in thinking the theory is to do the slow method to 41/2 mg then stay on this a month and then start again if ok. Could do with some advice.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

You are down to a low dose and a stage that has given many of us trouble. I stayed there for three months as directed by GP and only tried to get lower if I was completely comfortable.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Also it is often recommended that you do not reduce by more than 10% so that means cutting your pills ( as long as they are not the coated ones ). Alternatively you can reduce in tiny steps by perhaps reducing to the next level on alternate days or spacing the reductions even less frequently.... as one day a week then the lower dose twice a week and so on.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
You may not find this necessary but what is essential is not to reduce while in pain because you'll only find yourself back on a higher dose.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Hi Emis I am going to try reducing but am starting from 25mg. Every time I try to reduce to 20mg the pain comes back. Today I got some 1mg tablets so hope to start the slow reduction process. It is going to take a long time but at the moment I am not getting away from 25 anyway. Are many people starting from such a high dose? It sounds impossible to get down under 10mg. It would be good to hear if anyone starting a 1mg reduction from 25 did get down to a very small dose.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I began at 20MG and reduced 2.5MG per month. (For example, 17.5MG second month, 15MG third month, 12.5MG fourth month, 10MG fifth month - January 2017).	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
February 2017 I will take 9MG, March 2017 I will take 8MG. Doc prescribes 5MG pills and 1MG pills. So February I take one 5MG and four 2MG tablets daily. So far no flares. I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop though.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Have been on a steady reduction rate from15mg of prednisolone from last March until two weeks ago, mid Jan./17 I had been on 1 mg for the last month, then I was taken off steroids.

You would be extremely lucky if you are off within a year?   Ten months from 15 mg to zero is very fast!

Hi Emis. I am about to try your really slow reduction method. I am on 15mg and tried to reduce 1mg a week to get to 10mg and it did not work.

I have been on Prednisolone since 2007 since my GP diagnosed my aching legs and arms due to PMR. Initially on 15mg dose the pains disappeared quickly  and after a month I was down to 10mg. After 12 months this was deduced to 7.5 then after a year to 5mg. I have been trying to get the dose down since then. In September last year I was on 4mg and appart from a little acid reflux I was in no serious discomfort with minor stiffness. This year I have been making more effort to reduce my dependance on Prednisolone, and reduced to 3mg. I had a bone scan and was diagnosed with Osteopenea, my GP put me on Adcal vitamin D3 and calcium. I reduced Prednisolone to 2mg but the PMR  symptoms came back with a vengence. I have had severe body stiffness in legs and upper arms and hands, and been feeling very weak but have tried to do as much exercise as possible walking mainly.  The stiffness in back arms and legs is worse first thing in the morning for an hour or two. Taking Paracetamol helps to aleviate the pains. I am reluctant to go back on a higher dose of Prednisolone but may have to go up to 4mg. I am seeing my GP next week to discuss.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
If you were comfortable on 3mgs. I think I'd stay there or even, if necessary, increase up to 5 to have decent quality of life. Lots of us have found 5 a bit of a sticking point and several are happy to stay there for life if necessary.. Ten years may feel like a life sentence especially if, like me, you are not keen on drugs but so is the pain of PMR a life sentence, isn't it?	3	5	3	3.666666667	0.6666666667	1.333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667

Thank you for your reply. I am fortunate I have a sympathetic GP who has already said I may need to remain on a low dose of steride. The main concern comes from the female doctors concerned about osteoperosis and kidney damage. However I am now taking the Adcal tbs which should be beneficial to the bones. Appart from the stiffness I feel OK and at 77yrs that cant be bad.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Glad you're happy with your GP as I was with mine. They do worry about the bone thinning with age and steroids, I know. I was not able to take the bisphosphonate  Alendronic Acid and just had calceos but when I had a total hip replacement four years ago aged 81 the surgeon said that I had "amazing bone density for my age" so obviously bone problems are not inevitable.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hello Betty, Good to hear that at 81 your bone density is good. I am alternating 3mg and 4mg Predisone daily. I still have stiffness in upper arm and back of my legs first thing in the morning, but carry on regardless and it usually eases up by late morning. Best regards David	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hello and thank you again for sharing this very helpful post. I read it sometime ago but couldn't find it s second time but wanted to try to help my monther reduce her current steroid dose. She is also on MXT and has had  both medicines for the last two years. I've not followed it quite right but wondered if anyone could advise on next steps as we have reached 6 days on 2.5mg and 1 day on 5mg. What should we do next? Thank you.	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1	
I'm not very good at using this forum so forgive if I do it wrong, ok? I was using this method but had a return of pain, fatigue and stiffness when I tried to go from 5 mg to 4.  I went back up to 5 mg for 10 days and feel better again. So...can I now go down to 4 1/2 mg using the dsns method or do I stay on the 5 mg for a whole month? A little background--I feel pretty miserable most of the time, especially mornings, then I perk up a little in the afternoons.  Diagnosed with poly last September, started pred in October. Thanks! (I feel kinda alone as I can't find a soul who has ever heard of it). Except my doc who says he has 5-6 cases a year so this forum is s blessing.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Have had PMR for 1 year 2 months. Began at 20 mg.  Have faithfully followed DSNS method to the letter from about 9 mg level on. It really works for me. Have never missed a dose. I chart it out on paper for a month at a time, and put the pills in the little week-at-a-time plastic containers.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I have never met another person - in person - who has PMR either. I have more up days than down. I volunteer at the local USO and will soon begin volunteering at the local elementary school library. I retired from teaching 6th grade science about 3 years ago. We still like to travel, but we have moderated plans and locations a lot.	2	1	1	1.333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					1.333333333

This stage is very hard on the carer. In this area the clinic that deals with this is the Memory Clinic.

My wife was referred to it following a memory blank of several hours. After many weeks she was discharged as she could not tolerate Donepezil and with the formal diagnosis of MCI.

Possibly your husband might seek a referral to the Memory Clinic as there are drugs that can help some patients to improve their memory (and other symptoms) or slow the deterioration. That might ease your husband's distress. It might also help you.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

As the disease progresses your wife is likely to start to exhibit some very challenging behaviours, unpredictable because of the individuality of the disease. But for example my mother cried an awful lot, was terribly disoriented and wouldn’t settle and also wandered off a lot.

Your advice is helpful. There is an Alzheimers website in UK. I am rather restricted in gaining none website help.

I find that everyone is talking about dementia, but it's all about the 'big picture'. My Dad saw several specialists but because he did not fit the particular criteria for the kinds of research they were doing they were not that interested in him and was pretty much left to flounder.  He hasn't seen a specialist since being diagnosed with FTP four years ago. There definitely needs to be more support.	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1

It’s heartwarming to see that you care so much for your wife and her happiness. That’s terrible about her mental health team – medical professionals should always be working for the greater good and not holding any sort of grudge. Its very important that you discuss the situation with your wife openly so as to gradually build comfortability with the subject.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
Thank you so much. I am sorry for the delay in replying. My wife attributes my comments on dementia as an expression of my Anxiety/Depression. So until she checks with her GP or psychiatrist and asks a direct question she will hold to the diagnosis of MCI which is what the psychiatrist told her. The same psychiatrist told me, when he was treating my depression, that she has Alzheimers. As you advise, I should much rather be mutually open with her.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I feel extremely guilty that my mum has gone into care and, like you, feel that she is being over-sedated so that she will 'conform'. However, mum is so much improved when she is taking the Memantine, much more lucid, and I feel actually that is why the professionals have taken her off it. I am quite sure that her sedating medication has been increased, last night for instance, she was rather emotionless and extremely sleepy, jumping in her sleep too. She is still not opening her eyes when talking to me and even eating and I am really worried. 	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1

My father (68 years) has recently started forgetting small things here and there throughout the day (forgetting to lock the door, not feeding his cat, not turning off the TV, etc) and I suspect that he may have started developing dementia or alzheimer's (I am not really sure... need to go to get him checked with a doctor).	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1	
Research is still going on. For a clear cut answer we have to wait. On the basis of research we make assumptions. Some of the assumptions make sence. I also go through a lot of reseach because one of my relatives is diagnosed with the Alzheimer's to find the solution and subsiquently writen an article in sooper article dot com.

You could be worrying over nothing, I think you should go ahead and start the ball rolling to find out. If you get a positive result you can at least start on medication.

I too am in the early stages and I'm happier knowing. I can laugh about it and at times I could cry about it. There is no cure, but they can try to slow it down.

You SHOULD see your doctor with your concerns.  S/he will carry out a preliminary 'test' (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) to see if your concerns warrant a psychiatric evaluation.  Many local doctors (GPs) MAY make a preliminary 'diagnosis' of dementia, but it takes further investigation to ascertain which specific type of dementia it is.  (Alzheimer's disease IS the most common type of dementia, but there are a whole host of others.)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
As lostinFrance correctly states, you could be worrying over nothing.  There are many conditions which mimic the different types of dementia ... sometimes called 'pseudodementias' that can be corrected if an underlying cause can be found and put right.  For instance, a lack of vitamin B12 can lead to a condition called pernicious anaemia which can very closely mimic dementia, and this can VERY OFTEN be corrected with vitamin B12 supplements ... often in fhe form of injections. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

How long have you been on amitriptyline? I was on for two months before weaning off it. I've been off two weeks and muscle twitching started about a week after my last dose. Calve muscle twitches non stop. A little twitching in shoulder.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
My twitches today are mainly in the bottom of my feet and my calves but I do get them in all sorts of random places too - I took some magnesium last night and this morning which seems to be helping a bit but it's still concerning me...	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

10mg is a very low dose. It isn't something that will work instantly. You should give it a few weeks and if it still isn't helping then you may need to see your doctor again for an increase or to try something else. I started on 50mg but I don't take it for anxiety though.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
I would not think 10mg would help you, I take 20mg for pain, I have also just recovered from depression and I take 40mg of fluoxetine for that, a low dose of amitriptyline is normally used for pain, I would think you need a stronger dose for anxiety.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
So I've been on amitriptyline (10mg) for about 5 weeks and missed 2 nights (not consecutively) last week then started to feel shaky all over, especially my hands (not visible). I decided to come off the amitriptyline as I'd been worried about side effects when I started and this concerned me. I went down to 5mg and the next day the shaking was worse.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I had muscle twitches all over my body about every 30 seconds. Plus horrible nausea that I didn't have when on it.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
I have been on this for over 5 years and stopped and started it without any of these symptoms. I was on 50mg then increased to 100mg+ but only took it when I needed to. I found taking it daily wasn't as effective. Your doctor would be the best person to ask regarding this though.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

I am 49 years old and have just been prescribed up to 100mg of this drug to help me sleep. I have only been taking it for about 2 months, I started off on a lower dose. In the last 3 weeks I have got blurred vision in my right eye. I have been to the optitions 3 times and have 3 pairs of new glasses, all of which I can't see out of them. Have been back to my gp and asked for a refferal to an eye specialist.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Sometimes medications effect our bodies with contraindications. You are taking 100mg of this medication.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
The drug is an old Anti depressent medication and it acts as a very nice sleeping tablet. Some of the contrindications are quite extensive and alarming although generally the most extreme of the medications are very rare.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I suffer problems with my eyes and most times I put these concerns down to the computer. A pair of computer glasses gets rid of the glare here and prevents some headaches. There may be a problem with how and when you take the drug, in your case it is a sleeping tablet so that is you will take it about half an hour before bed and sleep.	2	4	3	3	1	1	0					3	
I was taking Topiramate for migraines and I thought it could be this drug that was causing my blurred vision so I told my gp I wanted to stop taking it as it wasn't making any difference to the amount of migraines i was getting. I have reading glasses which were fine up until 3 weeks ago when I started with the blurred vision. It is the same in the mornings and evenings and in any sort of light conditions. I just feel as though the optitions and gp are not really bothered but it is effecting every part of my waking day.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

 I have seen the opticians several times and upgraded my prescription. I also find that bright lights such as headlights cause me problems.

It's a very old drug still in use, which is rather alarming for new patients as there is so much evidence suggesting it would be best to take it off the market completely. However, having said that, many people have been taking it for years without complications and would attest that it works for them. There are newer, less contraversial meds now and I wonder whether it is a cost issue with the NHS. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I have taken 25 mg amitriptyline forever (it seems) and take 2.5 mg ambien when I have trouble sleeping.

This seems to be just what I have been looking for. After a flare-up in July I was put back to 15 mg for 5 days, then 10 for a month and reductions of 1 mg per month.

I have been doing a little research, and have found that it is very important to take the prednisone in the AM. Our Adrenals begin their work early in the AM and we need to mimic the Adrenals with our meds.	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3	
I am down to 5 mg from 20 mg using the DSNS method shared above. Thanks to my husband, I have never missed a dose. I have mapped out every dose by date... down to  0 mg in a small notebook, and now I fill one of my five small weekly pill containers with pills for one week (I do a month worth at a time).  My Rheumy says the Adrenals normally produce about 7.4 mg of cortisol, so the fact that I have had no flare so far is a pretty good indication that my Adrenals are functioning.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
My next question- we are going to Florence, Italy for 2 weeks in December- there is a 5 hour time difference. If I take the prednisone at the same USA time every day (6:30 AM USA is 11:30 AM ITALY) is that early enough in the day? If I switch to 6:30 AM Italy time, that is 1:30 AM USA time. Is that too early? I don't want a flare now because of the time change!!!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I think for the majority taking Pred. in the morning is right but it was not for me. When I complained of the over hyped rapid pulse semi panic feeling that followed within two or three hours of taking my steroids, my GP said to try taking them at 9.00 PM instead. To my delight and his interest it worked and I remember him saying " I'll note that for future reference". I continued to take them at night until I got to zero and the unwanted symptoms did not return. It did not affect my sleep.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Yes, taking prednisone in the morning works for most, but it did not work for me either because I would be in pain until almost noon to get relief.  I am a morning person, and need to "get going" right away.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

How long are you going to stay at 7 before you try 6.5 again? And are you doing the dsns method of reducing or going straight to 6.5?  I might be at the same place as you, hard to figure it all out.

I am doing DSNS and am to 5. Took my first 4 - day before yesterday. DSNS means I will have 5 days of 5 before 4 again. It's very gradual. If I feel like the flu is coming or achy, I can slow down even more and stay at 5 another week. My Rheumy says DO NOT jump back up much higher- just to last mg that worked and maybe stay there a month. I want off, but this is the only way that will work for me I believe. Good luck!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Oh. Don’t jump back to higher. Just last dose that worked. Hmmm. I just went back to 10 for couple days after being on 7 to 6.5, towards the end of the sequence. Did too much physically (walking), lotsa pain especially at night in bed so I ratcheted it up to 10 mg a couple days. Got relief at night although I’m  not one of the lucky ones, I’m never ever pain free.  Went back down to 7 this morning. Then will pick up where I left off on the dsns reduction to 6.5.  I know I can’t rush but my body hates pred...many side effect	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I'm brand new here so I'm probably not following the correct protocol.  I have been on prednisone for 3 years starting I think on 50 mg and was until today on just 2 mg with no pain UNTIL my son died 2 weeks ago, and today I'm in pain ALL OVER.  I have a regularly scheduled doctor's visit in a couple of weeks, but I believe I've figured out that prednisone is in my case due to stress.  When I first began prednisone because of all-over pain, my son had just been diagnosed with a terminal disease.  Now, as I said, I am way down to just 2 mg a day and today the all-over pain came back and - guess what - most extreme stress ever in my life now with my precious son dying. I had taken 2 mg this morning and with the pain this afternoon just took an additional 2 mg.  We'll see,  Thanks.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
You are absolutely right to up the Pred when you are in the middle of this shattering experience of the loss of your most precious son. Take what you need until you feel less numbed and shocked. You can do without the increase in physical pain whilst dealing with all that’s happening at the moment. I’m pretty sure emotional stress impacts on our symptoms and thank goodness treatment helps.

Jenny, sorry to hear about the tiredness. Fortunately, my tiredness disappeared after the diagnosis and I began taking 20mg/day of Prednisone. I was so tired for the previous 2 months before diagnosis,I could not exercise. One morning, I could not move literally. I was paralyzed and lying in bed.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
After a visit to the doctor and 11 blood test for everything from , Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, PMR was diagnosed by my doctor.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
He put me on 20mg and said to call him in 3 hours, if the pain was subsiding quite a bit he had made the correct diagnosis.The regimen was 20 mg for a month, then to 15mg. After seeing a RA specialist here in the US, she reduce me  to 10 mg/day for a month then 9 and now on 8mg/day for a month. Her plan is to reduce me by 1mg/ month until I can hopefully come of the Prednisone completely. Blood test are taken on every monthly visit. Coming off Prednisone at a faster rate can cause problems unrelated to PMR.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Jenny- I experience fatigue - you are not alone in this.  Caring for your husband must be very stressful and can trigger many aspects of the disease to be sure. I am 55 and up until my PMR diagnosis & symptoms, I had so much energy. I can’t keep up with my friends and when I try, I have a setback of pain and fatigue.  Pacing myself is an experience of trial & error but so necessary... at least for some of us!!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Connie, thank you for this.  I did get down to 7mg but started to experience terrible pain and abject exhaustion.  I went back to 9mg and for the first few days felt a lot better but since have been very tired and very painful.  I will not go up any further.  Have also been suffering with some bad intestinal problems.  Anyone else had this?  Boy I am sick of whining.  It is not me.  Wouldn’t it be great if we could have a huge meeting in one of our countries where we could all get together and talk about it then have fun.  I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired and I want fun!  Anyone else?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Jenny - I too have intestinal issues.  I was on 6 mg but recently increased to 8mg due to pain and severe dryness in many areas- eyes, throat, skin, sinuses. I have difficulty with my bowel movements - it comes and goes. From diarrhea to the opposite!  I take care in what I eat to try to promote regularity: I have added flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, avocado, dried prunes, even Laxaday & senna tea.  I was diagnosed with collagenous colitis a couple of years ago.  I have apts with a variety of specialists to see if we can figure out what is going on or if it’s a “flare” of some sort and I’m seeing my Rheumy for follow up in 2 weeks... I will let you know if I get any additional info or insight.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

To the best of my knowledge, and I'm no expert, if you have PMR it is extremely unlikely you will be on the medications forever.  Most people recover somewhere in the 2 to 6 year time frame although there are always outliers.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I have been reducing pred for over a year from 30mg down to 3mg without problem (but not as per the table as above). However, although ok on 3mg, and more or less ok on alternate days 3/2mg, when, as instructed by my doctor to go with 2mg, my PMR has come back with a vengeance.  So I've gone straight back on 3mg (last two days) but still very achy and legs feel inflamed, particularly when lying in bed.  Haven't had chance to go back to doctor again (she's off sick!) and you have to book up, but managed to get in a blood test, haven't yet been told result but I know the ESR must be raised.  Would you say 3mg is enough or should I go to 5mg?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
To have reached 3 form 30 without problem is very good going.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Most of us have reached sticking point(s) at some stage, usually before getting to 3.  After several set backs my GP told me to stay on 10 for three months.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
Not qualified to prescribe, of course, but from my and others' experience I would say go back to 5 and if that works, fine;  If not, increase it until you do feel comfortable. If the bloods show raised markers then you'll be sure you need a higher dose for a bit. Unfortunately, sometimes the markers do not reflect the increased inflammation.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

As I have been on steroids since 2011 and have had 3 serious flare ups with the resultant rise in steroid doses and the harsh reduction programme that follows  I think I will give the DSNS method a try as the rheumatology clinic I go to twice a year is very keen to put me on Methotrexate and I am not keen to do that.  I am currently down to 5mgms prednisolone daily and still have all the pmr symptoms.  My recent blood result   crp : 38   and esr :19  .  I have to hope my Gp will permit some regular blood tests to monitor.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
It sounds as if 5mg is too low if you still have the pain of pmr . Like Eileen says treAt the symptoms not the lab results .	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Hi I got down from 15 mg to 6 mg months after diagnosis. Symptoms are manageable though legs and feet tingle first thing and ache. walking through treacle aptly describes symptoms but they are tolerable. Attempts to get to 5 mg or lower aborted due to pain increasing. Taking vitamin D, magnesium and calcium supplements and omega fish oils. Have supplements worked for others? Main concern is osteoporosis if on pred for too long.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I was prescribed Calceos ( calcium and Vit D3 ) while I was on Pred as I couldn't take Alendronic Acid. I also have taken CLO for many years.

Hello all, very interesting looking at the various experiences.  So, here's mine.  Diagnosed with PMR (but no GCA!) last September.  SED rate was over 130.  So bad it kicked an elevated heart enzyme, and they first thought I had a mild heart attack.  Luckily, doctors diagnosed the PMR in about 2 weeks.  Lost about 25 lbs. in that short time.  Started with a huge injection of Pred, then to 40 to 20 to 10 tablets.  Since then, we gone down 1 per month, and I'm at 6.  Once I go to 5, they will slow it down even more by going down 1 every 2-3 months.  So far, so good.  Hard to distinguish any muscle pain or stiffness with physical activity - like going to the gym, etc.  From this discussion, it sounds like I will really find out where I am with this when I get under 5mg.  Although, the slow rate they're taking through may be the best approach.  Also, take calcium and D supplements.  All blood work looks good. Weight gain is very frustrating...  When people say debilitating, I totally get it!  Worst illness experience ever.  I'm pretty pain tolerant - but this was horrible...	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
This is an interesting discussion and one that I probable should have applied to myself. My inflammation, which is measured by: Erythrocyte Sediment Rate was in February 24mm when on 3mg of Prednislone. I had no feelings of  pain or stiffness, this only occurred on 1mg. Since finishing it has increased to 27mm. So in theory I should re introduce the Pred to 3mg and then apply the slow taper	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
This topic is very interesting and I would be very interested in doing this method but one thing worries me.....I have read lots of posts on this forum and other forums for FMR/GCA where people are upping and lowering their doses of Pred, are they doing this with their Rheumy's/GP's knowledge and agreement or are they doing it by themselves?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I am seeing my Rheumy in a weeks time and will ask her about this method as I have gotten down to 12.5mg from 20mg but the symptoms returned almost immediately so I went back up to 15mg every other day and this seems to work (even though I don't like doing it without GP/Rheumy backing), I don't think that it is withdrawal from the Pred causing the symptoms though. Hopefully she will agree that this method will be of benefit to me so that I can try it at least, I'm not sure what I'll do if she doesn't because I don't think I could put up with the pain it's causing (I'm disabled and am in pain 24/7 because of it so any extra pain makes life pretty hard to say the least!)	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
It would be wise for you to copy and paste your question into a new post as this will only be seen by a very few people followng the old thread.  If the symptoms returned immediately they could have been withdrawal, but a drop of 2.5 makes it difficult to know exactly how much more you may need.  Are you taking 12.5 one day and 15 in between?  Are you able to get 1 mg tablets, it makes it easier to drop in smaller steps.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Thanks for replying, I do understand that only people following this post will see it but as my post is related to the OP I thought it best to post here. I do see your point though and as I have also said about changing dosages of Pred I should post a new topic regarding this.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
To answer your question, yes I am taking 12.5mg one day and 15mg the next and so on. I could probably get 1mg tablets if I asked my GP but knowing him he will probably read me the riot act (in a nice way) for meddling with the dosage  without talking to him or my Rheumy! lol  As I said in my last post, I'm due to see my Rheumy soon so will take it up with her.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Because I was already disabled when I was diagnosed with FMR it's hard to know what is causing the pain in the first place, and now I have been diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis which also causes pain it really is hard to know which of the 3 is causing the most pain and when.  Phew, it doesn't rain but pours eh!!! :-)	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I was on 20mg of Prednisone to begin. Stayed there about a month. Then I began the DSNS method with my Rheumy’s approval. I never missed a dose and dropped all the way down to 3mg before I thought some pain was returning. He said that in his experience, 3 or 4 mg is about the spot for trouble if one is going to have any. My Rheumy was adamant about only going back up to the LEAST possible dose that would stop the pain. I only went up 2mg and resumed the DSNS method from that level. I had PMR from June 2016 to June 2018. I think this method allowed my adrenals to resume working slowly while controlling the pain. Knock on wood, I am still pain free. My Rheumy monitored my blood work every 3 months. The SED rate, and the other one I can’t recall right now, fell slowly and steadily back to normal. He did a bone scan in 2017 and again in 2018. I had no bone loss! Which is amazing for my age, 67. I went to OsteoStrong, osteogenic loading, weekly and took Vitamin D3 and calcium supplements throughout. I had no other diseases or disorders other than PMR. There, I think you have it all. Always follow your Doctor’s advice??	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I'm sorry to hear this.  Wouldn't prednisone also help the pulmonary fibrosis, however?  In which case maybe it's too soon to be tapering at all, let alone by these large steps.  But I really don't know, I have no medical training, but maybe a question to ask the doctor.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
If you are concerned about changing your dose without the knowledge of your rheumy., what I do is contact his/her office, and leave a message regarding what I have done and why. Then if they are unhappy with what you are doing they can call you or give you an appointment to go in. I have not had any problems with this and have perhaps done it twice in one year.	5	2	4	3.666666667	1.333333333	1.666666667	0.3333333333					3.666666667

Do be VERY careful. I managed to get to 7 mg, thought I had a real victory. Had a bit of very minor surgery, did not increase my dosage, a few days later started to feel really bad! No energy, hard to breath, racing heart, nearly fainting...just a host of terrible symptoms. hospital emergency room four times in three weeks, No one...not the rheumatologist, the cardiologist, the nuerologist or my primary gerontologist could figure out the problem. Finally went to an endocrinologist and she quickly said I had adrenal insufficiency from coming off the prednisone too quickly after the surgery. I doubled my dose and within two days was almost back to normal. I'm trying hard to get back down, reducing the dosage by 1/2 mg every two weeks, Good luck to you all.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

such a surprise that none of the docs.. not the internist, rheumatoligist, gerontologist, cardiologist, Er doc, gastro guy... none if them could figure out why I kept crashing . finally i went to an endochronologist and she diagnosed me within five minures with adrenal insufficency . i upped the prednisone for a few days and have been fine ever since. every physician that prescribes prednisone should warn their patients about this possibilty as they decrease their dose and they should instruct them to increase the dosage whenever the patient is having any type of surgery thanks so much for your post.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

"A group of us worked out reduction schemes individually that have allowed us to reduce far further than ever before but they are all basically the same - and they were based on a scheme a Swedish gentleman worked out when he simply couldn't get below 3mg without pain. Img at that level is 33%, 1/2mg is 17% - way above the 10% that has been recommended for years. So he used table to see the daily doses and took the new dose on one day, old dose for a few days and then proceeded by repeating that and then reducing the number of days of old dose - until he got to everyday new dose. It worked, he got off pred and has been off pred for at least 3 years (it could be longer). Something similar to mine is being tried by a consultant rheumatologist in the north of England and he too finds it works for every single patient he has given it to.

Obviously, prednisolone is an immunosuppressant and people who are immunosuppressed are classed as 'vulnerable' as far as covid 19 is concerned. My question is, does the dose make a big difference? I am a health care worker and currently have reached 8mg, almost at 7.5, using dsns. I only work 2 days a week but am planning to continue doing so. I wonder if I should be staying at home - I just don't like to let others down. 8 mgs is almost the same as my body would produce so maybe I am not immunosuppressed??? Any thoughts please?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I've read so many posts lately that I can't give the exact details of what I read, but in the last couple days I saw that a highly-placed rheumy in England spoke of 10 mg as being the dose to be below. Above that and your immune system is compromised, best as I can recall. However, remember that your immune system is already a train wreck from the PMR which is still in you. Your immune system is compromised - it's just a matter of how severely.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Yes ,It is an immunosuppressant & I'm down to 4.5mgs.after going down very slowly for 2.5 years. I got the 2 worst flu viruses of my life in Oct. & in early Jan. along with a strange illness that attacked my nerves for 33 days with excruciating ,electrical shock like stabbing pains in my chest,back,& then up in my head & at times it was shocking me every 5 seconds.The E.R.doctor said he had heard of other patients with the same thing but they don't know what it is. When I got the 2 flu viruses my lungs were filling up so fast that I thought I was going to drown & the antibiotics worked for only a few days at the end of the week that I was on them & the infection in my lungs came back within 2 to 3 days both times & lasted for 2 months each.I was on 4 other medications during this time also. I got several skin cancers burned off my arms & one on my leg last year & they all got so infected which isn't the norm for my arms. My rheumatologist & primary dr. both said that even though I'm down to 4.5mgs that I have little immune system left . SO SCARY ! Iwould never survive the corona virus since I thought I wasn't going to make it with 2 regular flu viruses that almost took me out & corona covid 19 is 10 times stronger. Best wishes !

The 2 flu viruses that I got were in late Oct. & the 1 week in January . I think it was around New Years Eve that it was 1st announced to the World that there was a virus killing people in China. I stay home most of the time unless it's to my doctors offices. It wasn't in the U.S. or most other countries at that time. I did get the flu shot in early January since I thought I was finally over the Oct. flu but that night my granddaughters came over with a runny nose,& sore throat which I told my daughter to never so that to me again since I think the combo of the flu shot that day, where you can not take it if you are ill, & my granddaughters giving me their fresh colds on top of the flu shot that made me so sick. As far as Shingles with that 33 day illness with the worst stabbing pains , it was on both sides of my chest ,back,& then up to my head . Shingles always attacks only one side of the body.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

The official advice from rheumatologists is that above 10mg/day is high risk, PMR itself is is increased risk if you were to develop Covid19. Do you have any other comorbidities? And where do you work? They are both significant factors.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
In some regions they are looking for nurses and doctors to staff the Hub to support 111. It is probably something to discuss with your manager and find out if there is a role that keeps you well away from the front-line. But it is difficult isn't it - one of my daughters has had her "highly vulnerable" message so should be isolating despite working in the ED. Haven't heard from the other but she must be the same with asthma - but she is in Scotland so I don't know if she gets the same consideration. OTOH - there will be a role for you all once this is over to replace exhausted staff.	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1

There is so much they don’t know about the medications they prescribe and a lot more they don’t tell us. I went from 15mls down to zero of PREDNISONE and PREDNISOLONE. I got conflicting answers on the difference between the two and why rheumatologist and GP kept changing from one to the other and back. With the Covid-19 now I wonder if the PMR or medication has affected my immune system now both have ceased. I am a 77 y/o male with Type2 diabetes, elevated BP and long-term congestion issues. My daily medications include twice the standard dose of Lercanidipine (Zanidip) = 20mg I received advice from a GP that BP medications especially Lercanidipine act as a receptor for Covid-19 and substantially increase the risk of infection. My GP has received no advice in this regard. The disparity between Corona’s severity between age groups could have more to do with our medications than just our age. We don’t know how any of our medications affect our immune system now or down the track. Our individual system is a work in progress for each of us. Covid-19 once in our system will likely leave an immunity against re-infection but possibly for a short time. Like the common cold it could keep happening with these more serious ramifications.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I took Duodart, with a possible PCa risk and ended up with severe prostate cancer. Am now on Trulicity (dulaglutide)with a possible thyroid cancer risk and Lercanidipine with a possible increased risk of Covid-19 infection. The PMR is likely still an issue as could be the Preds I took back then for it. All my medications have a list of side-effects as long as my arm. It’s a difficult path we follow with so much unknown or withheld information but we just have to go along with it and hope.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

What is fairly certain is that your PMR plus diabetes and raised BP and age would increase risks but if you are no longer on pred that improves the risk of contracting CV in the first place.

My (now) 77 year old husband George reduced his Pred to 5 mgs by last September, and he has continued (without trouble except tiredness) with that dose for 6 months.	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1	
He saw his rheumatologist here in France last week. She's given him a new prescription, for Pred at 4 and a half mg, and now also Hydrocortisone at 10 mg . He is to continue another 6 months with these 2 drugs - but to gradually reduce the Pred further.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Hi Amanda, I hope you're both doing ok. I don't know anything about the Hydrocortisone but the injection into the knee is site specific, as in will only stay in the knee area, and doesn't affect the amount of steroids he is on, so that's fine and hopefully he'll get some relief from his knee pain with that. Some people can get up to a years relief, some much shorter, but to my mind, worth trying. I would be concerned that the doctor only prescribed 4.5 mgs of Pred, as this doesn't allow for the DSNS system of reducing, which at that level would be very important to do, going straight to 4.5mg could cause problems, he needs a bit of wriggle room, maybe a phone call to the doctor to at least send an amended prescription of 5mgs. At this level he shouldn't be rushing his reduction. Take care and stay safe.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

The 10mg hydrocortisone is only the same as 2.5mg pred. HC isn't as effective for PMR as pred because it lasts less time in the body.

You say you would go about it a different way - could you tell us how, perhaps..?	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I wouldn't have added HC to raise the total dose at this point - I would have waited for him to continue reducing the pred slowly, 1/2mg a month, until the fatigue got to be a problem. Then I might have considered replacing the pred with the equivalent dose of pred - because by giving him the HC instead of the pred it would have stimulated the adrenals better. HC is more like cortisol, the natural corticosteroid, and so using that instead of pred means the adrenals experience something more like normal. But why he's putting them together I just don't understand. Too tired to explain more just now.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Amanda4567 Hi, I have been taking Pred. and Hydrocortisone since last year, I started on 1x10mgs. am. 1x5mgs. at lunchtime, and 1x5mgs mid afternoon. They stopped the mid afternoon pill (Hydro.) as it was affecting my sleep, I also take 5mgs. of Pred. I also inject Tocilizumab every week. I seem to be o.k. so far.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I am recently diagnosed with PMR. Started on 15 mgs prednisolone. Have read how GCA can occur and have noticed fir three mornings jaw pain when eating breakfast left side same side as the PMR. I've looked at the symptoms of GCA and I'm scoring 1 out if 5. Dr said I needed ESR crp fbc visc u & e in turn contacted the Rheumatologist and appointment tomorrow morning! Dr told me to up steroids to 40 mgs. I am grateful I haven't got a severe headache but the more I read about GCA I am scared.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I never had much of a headache at all, then got jaw ache, swollen arteries at both temples, sore scalp. I then started with double vision. It is scary, but you will be o.k. as it is being treated. I started on 40mgs. and I have always wandered if it was the right dose (this was 5ys. ago). Everyone is different, so stay positive if you can and best wishes.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Don't be scared, have the tests done to confirm your diagnosis! I have had GCA and PMR since I was 63 and I am now 68. I had pains in the back of my head and blurred vision- no jaw pain! My GCA was confirm via temple biopsy on both sides of my head- a fairly simple procedure. Each individual presents differently. Listen to your Dr. ! I almost went blind. If you do have GCA do not ignore any course of therapy prescribed. I am presently living a normal life, but it can be along trip to get back to normal.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I only had PMR but a friend had GCA ( no PMR ) and was started on 60 mg. He was an electrician so sight very important. He continued to work throughout his treatment which lasted about three or four years ( would have to check that ) and made a complete recovery with no recurrence. He later had complicated heart surgery and lived to enjoy life into his mid eighties. It sounds as thought you were diagnosed and treated promptly so that is good news. Best of luck.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hey all, new member here. I've had PMR for about a year. I've tapered down per month, finally from 3 mg prednisone to 2 mg to 1 mg and finally zero about a month ago. At zero mg my symptoms were "kind of" there, but not bad at all, and my inflammation markers were "normal," but right on the high edge of normal.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Now, after a month without prednisone, the symptoms are slowly increasing - hard to pick up something from the floor, if you know what I mean. Normally, I'd have no problem getting back on a low dose of prednisone, but with this coronavirus pandemic, I certainly am not eager to compromise my immune system at all! I'm between a rock and a hard place!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I'm ambulatory but easily fatigued. I could probably handle this without prednisone, but now I seem to be having some symptoms of GCA. (I didn't have this a year ago when the PMR was really bad.) An occasional "feeling" at the temples, not persistent. Now a weak headache. I do NOT want an arterial biopsy, which sounds excessive to me, particularly if the treatment for GCA is just to get back on prednisone (but at a bit higher dosage).	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Well, that's my circumstance. This pandemic really complicates matters for PMR folks. And obviously millions of people are seriously affected by it. Any comments or advice appreciated!	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
Speaking for myself, I'd do just about anything to avoid going near a health care facility right now. Of course, an an extreme emergency there's no choice, but if I were you I'd start taking PRED again. I got down to 0.5 mg a few months ago, and same thing happened to me. I hit it with 5 MG for a few days, then 4, then 3, then 2.5. It knocked it down to bearable symptoms. I'm at 2.0 right now and holding.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

I hear you! In fact, I just had a "virtual office visit" with my GP. It worked well! It was like a video meeting on skype, but they used "Microsoft Teams." I had to set it up ahead of time and download the software, but like I said, it worked. The doc said it was his first time using it, too. I basically filled him in on what's been happening and got a refill on prednisone (along with my other meds). Of course, I had to make my co-pay, which made it like a real office visit! :^/	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

It looks like you cane down too fast and the underlying disease lurks. There is no way you can force this. Without pred your body can be damaged by inflammation and you can become irreversibly blinded by GCA. Other wise forum members will share their experience.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Karen, thanks for yours and all replies! I had adhered to the directions of a rheumatologist in my taper. It had worked well until I got down to a couple mg, when the symptoms started "peeking over the edge," so to speak. As suggested, I'm going to have to bite the bullet with respect to Covid19, since these emerging Giant Cell symptoms are here now, and that can be pretty dangerous! So back to the prednisone. I've been staying inside, regardless.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

If 2 or 3 mg work for you it should not be compromising your immune system. Even if you need 5 mg for a week or so you should be fine. I believe the problem really is more serious for patients above 10 mg and definitely they should be very very careful at 20 mg and above. This from a post on the HealthUnlocked site a few days ago quoting a rheumatologist.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
The opinion I have found is that above 5mg pred is a possible concern - it probably doesn't make you more likely to catch it - after al, healthy people not on pred get it, but is a risk factor if you become ill. However, having active PMR is also a risk factor Officially, having PMR put you at increased risk, taking above 10mg pred also does so.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
It is very likely that if you react now, a few days at 5mg and then dropping to 3mg will keep things at bay and not pose a risk in the context of Covid19 providing you are social distancing consistently - hygiene measures and avoiding contact with people in general. You missed the signs - any returning symptoms is telling you to stop here.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Thanks Eileen and to all commenters! That is good news about 5 mg being unlikely to compromise the immune system much. That's really a relief. The beginning of symptoms consistent with Giant Cell Enteritis was pretty concerning, so I went ahead and took 3 mg. Pretty amazing stuff! A few hours later both PMR and GCE symptoms eased. I'll go ahead and take 2 mg more and stay with 5 mg for at least a few days.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Yeah Mich, my rheumatologist was skeptical that I even had PMR. I was already on prednisone before I saw her, so I had no symptoms and inflammation markers were zero. I knew this was not just old-age stiffness and soreness. It came on quick and severe a year ago. My GP was on it though.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Then there's Covid19. What a horrible global development! As I said, I'm just staying inside, maybe taking short walks. Best of luck to all!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I just thought I would share my experience with you. I came off Pred in January 2020 after about a year of being on it. I was able to do so because I had followed a very low carb diet lowering my inflammatory markers. Once I was off Prednisone, I started to have a few niggles of familiar pain and stiffness. My response to that was to even lower my carb intake more. This helped a lot and now in March, I am still careful with carb intake but a little more relaxed. The PMR, I feel, is not gone but can't get a grip on me either. I have full range of motion in my limbs. only my neck gets sore if I am at the computer too long. Eventually, I believe that I will win the battle. Just my experience but it might be helpful to you as well.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Have you increased your activity because you felt better? The pred has cured nothing, it just relieves the inflammation that causes the pain and stiffness - the underlying disease is still active and leaves your muscles intolerant of acute exercise.

I think many would agree that 15 mg is quite a low starting dose. I started on 20 mgs and some start on 25. Try upping your dose. Also take notice of what others have said; don't overdo things because the steroids, initially, give you an energy boost.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Realise you may have a long journey ahead of you. Learn to be patient, learn about the DSNS ( dead slow nearly stop) Google it, method of tapering your steroids. Don't be tempted to rush things or you will end up back where you started. Remember that the median duration of this disease is five point nine years. Start cutting your carbs drastically now before you start to gain weight from the steroid use. Start taking a vitamin k 2 and calcium supplement for your bone health.

Hi LJDuguid, we all have had different experiences. My advice to you is to learn to listen to your body. It will make your PMR journey easier. Do not reduce your Prednisone dosage if you have any PMR pain. Have a bone density scan, so you know the conditions of your bones. Look into taking Calcium, Magnesium, vitamin K2 and MSM for bone health. The side effects of Prednisone are not pleasant, but it controls the inflammation, which must be controlled. My PMR was so bad at one point I could not walk and was in a wheelchair. Stay ahead of the pain, which will keep you ahead of the inflammation. Good luck on your PMR journey stay positive, active and try to smile. Here's smiling at you. 🙂☘	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Advice to increase your dose is good BUT you are just starting out on this journey so this needs to be cleared with your doctor. Later when you are established on successful treatment you will, and should, have a lot of control over how you taper. Your doctor needs to know how you reacted to the 15 mg, and I suspect they will in fact suggest an increase is in order. But they need to know. There is always a chance that the diagnosis is in question so you don't want to muddy the diagnostic waters.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Check with your doctor. 15 might have been enough to 'knock it back' but not keep it down, speaking of inflammation. Beware of big drops in mg and unnecessarily big jumps back up. Question every thing your doc does/says/prescribes. Is it a rheumatologist or another doc? You want a specialist in steroid use which is more rheumatologist than GP. These forums have taught me more than my doc has had time to educate me. But ultimately I lean toward his knowledge. I have learned invaluable understanding from forums in regard to what questions to ask my doc. Make list before you go!!	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
Hi Clicklaura, I have found with a flare that I have been to up my dosage double, then triple for 3 or 4 days. Then reverse the amount and days on the same schedule as I increased. Stopping the flare and getting the inflammation under control. Unfortunately I have had too many flares in the almost four of my PMR journey. My first bad flare was not controlled and I increased from 7mg to 30mg in very small long increases. I have been taper from that experience 3 years in May. We are all individuals each case is different. DSNS method works that is one thing I believe is true for everyone. Good luck!🙂	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hey guys. My name is Brett. I have some numbers I'd like to share as well as my personal symptoms to see if anyone can give me guidance on how I can be healthier.	4	2	3	3	1	1	0					3

Age 24, male, 5"11', 190 lbs, caucasian of Hungarian and Irish descent. I have rod-cone dystrophy, probably unrelated, and the gene variants C282Y and H63D variants in the HFE gene. I've been tested for iron problems, but none came back out of normal levels. The numbers below are related to those tests. If you can give me any advice unrelated to those results, that is welcome too. Just trying to give a complete picture	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
First off, my primary issue is my bones. I have some arthritis in my neck but never had my hands x-rayed, but my neck doesn't hurt while my hands do. Doctors have been little help because they probably think I want pain meds, which I don't, I simply want to know why my hands hurt. Being visually impaired, they're my most useful tools and I don't think I can live a happy life if I don't get an answer and this keeps getting worse. My hands are always uncomfortable, but actions such as typing turns it into pain nearly immediately.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I don't take any medication. I drink between 200-400 mg of caffeine in the form of coffee and I use various nicotine products. Usually a vape, sometimes gum, sometimes cigarettes. My pain didn't get better when I quit nicotine and coffee for 6 months, but my energy/mental health got worse, so I started again. I've tried anti-depressants in the past but they didn't work great or they had side effects.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I've tried every supplement I can get my hands on and nothing helps any of my symptoms, but I'm desperate. I feel like time is wasting in my effort to live any resemblance of a happy life and I'm only moving backward in the meantime. All of the things I like doing require my hands and I've stopped doing them all due to pain.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Here are some numbers. Can you give me any guidance on what might be wrong and what I can do?

I want to lower my iron because my TIBC is low and my gene variants put me at risk for developing iron overload. Due to my desperation, I'm willing to try almost anything. I feel like my life is basically over at 24...too weak to do proper work, too tired to enjoy anything, and the things that bring me peace require my hands and the pain takes that from me. Bottom line is that I'm hurting too much to imply I'm healthy and it gets worse by the week. Ultimately, it is a desperate move to hopefully avoid future pain, even if my numbers are mostly healthy right now with a few exceptions that don't imply much.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

There may be some other nutrient deficiency or imbalance, such as magnesium or salt. If you feel unwell there is no doubt a reason and it may take a lot of detective work to find out what the source of the problem is. Once you find it it may well be something very easily sorted. Keep on reading, but look for the simple answers first. Rare diseases are just that, rare so the chances you have one is rare. Good luck!	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
The only thing I have to add (and again, no medical background here, but I think we all feel your pain....hang in there)....is be careful with the supplements.

I have heard from several medical people that sunshine is a disinfectant. So it would make sense to stay where you are. I live in Kansas (the midwest in the US) and things are closing fast, supplies are hard to come by. I've come to accept that I have to self isolate because I am a high risk patient.

Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with PMR 4 weeks ago. My rheumatologist put me on 20 mg of prednisone for 4 weeks, reducing to 15 mg , then to 5 mg until I return for my next visit in April. Last night I had severe leg cramps, Not just in the calves, but my entire leg. I have never had this before. Is this a side effect of the Prednisone? Before being diagnosed, I was in severe pain with major stiffness in pretty much all my joints. Very difficult to get out of bed and walk in the mornings. I just thought it was old age. I have always been a fairly active woman, and considered myself a young 67. But by the time I was 68, I felt I had aged 10 years. After 1 week on the prednisone I felt like a new woman. I don't feel quite as good now as I did 3 weeks ago, and will start reducing my dosage today. Is that normal? The information on this site has been so helpful. Thanks in advance for any information you my have on this matter.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I have PRM and GCA my dr ordered me to take 550 mg potassium daily with my pred. I have done so and only had leg cramps once in 6 years of treatment.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Hi Collen, I used to get cramps but i have been taking Magnesium for the last 5months and have only had it once since, do try it. Good Luck	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
The first thing to try for the cramp is magnesium - pred makes you lose more magnesium through the urine. I'd be wary of taking more potassium without having had blood tests and medical advice.- too much potassium is dangerous. But you can increase the amount you eat of foods with plenty of potassium such as:	2	2	2	2	0	0	0					2	
Bananas, oranges, cantaloupe, honeydew, apricots, grapefruit (some dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and dates, are also high in potassium)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Cucumbers	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Because you felt so much better did you try to go back to normal activity levels? The pred has cured nothing - it just relieves the inflammation caused by the underlying autoimmune disorder that causes it and that leaves the actual illness chugging along in the background, attacking the muscles and leaving them intolerant of acute exercise. If you do too much you will develop DOMS, delayed onset muscle soreness, as if you had done far too much exercise, and it will take much longer than usual to resolve.	4	2	0	2	2	0	2	INVALID		INVALID		2	
Thanks. I started taking magnesium today. And yes, I did go back to my original activity level. My shoulders and knees are more painful than 3 weeks ago. I felt so good that I did not think about still having the disease and the prednisone is really just keeping it under better control. I will have to be more mindful if that.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

This is not an answer for the cramps but an answer concerning the reduction. I speak from experience. Reducing by 5 mg at a time is risky as the PMR will flare right up again. I started by reducing 2.5 mg then by 1 mg and both times when I hit the 12 to 10 mg mark my pain returned.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
I am now reducing by .5 mg via DSNS and am at almost 10 mg without pain. Also I split the dose to half in the morning and half at night as I found taking it all in the morning did no work as each morning I was very stiff and sore until about noon.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

so I've been on amitriptyline since around december last year, taking 60mg every morning, first thing. Obviously I didn't begin with six, that's only been a few months. Anyway, I happened to think it would be a brilliant idea to overdose on it a couple days ago. I took around 50 10mg pills. Because of this I can't take it for fibromyalgia anymore. So I'm going cold turkey on a recent huge dose of amitriptyline and I have no idea what to expect and would like to hear your thoughts and insights.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I had been on and off amitriptyline for a while (I'm now completely off them) and I noticed an increased difficulty swallowing and indigestion, I always felt like food was getting stuck in my throat, this was whilst on one of the "breaks" I had and that was after being on 10mg so that dose could be enough for you it may just need time	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I havent taken amitriptyline for that but for pain, I started with 10mg for a week then upped the dose to 20mg it almost kicked in straight away, so I should increase your dose, when you feel its helped you can always try reducing it, I only take 10mg and the pain hasnt returned if it does I will just go back to 20mg.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

When I tried to go down to 5mg, from 10mg, a few years ago I got my migraines back so went back to 10mg. However, this time I've managed to get to 5mg without any trouble. My problem was going to less than 5mg. I have sought advice and been told that one way to reduce is to go to less for one night only then wait a few days before trying again so that the body has a chance to gradually get used to less.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I'm currently in the process of coming off them, and hopefully I'm pretty much there as I can't remember the last time I took 5mg (maybe a week ago). I've been amazed how hard it has been to come off them. I took 10mg for two weeks for pain but started feeling nauseous after two days that just got worse. I tried going cold turkey and just gave them up but after six days I had really bad nausea and felt like I was in a desert - constantly thirsty. I went back to half tablets (5mg) and have gradually weened myself off. I currently have abdominal pain but as my doc thinks I have fibro that's not unusual for me. I hadn't thought that it might be a withdrawal symptom from the amitriptyline.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I've also been feeling itchy all over the last three days. Again I've assumed that's fibro related but I guess it could be amitriptyline withdrawal.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

 I started by cutting the tablets in half and having 5mg a night, then 5mg every other night, then every two or three nights, then every four or five nights.

I have dropped to 10 mg of Nortriptyline from 12.5 mg over a month ago and three weeks ago debilitating acid reflux, nausea, burning in upper abdomen started with all kinds of gastritis sx.

Headaches will cease. It happened to me before. I hope you can get off very very slowly with minimal withdrawal this time. May I ask how long you put up with the withdrawal sx after getting hit on the 3rd day with them in your previous attempts?

Just an update i am now on 5mg of ami. i was worried the drop from 7.5mg to 5mg in 30 days would be too quick but all ok. I say all ok apart from  the odd headache and a weird  dizzy sensation i had twice last week. As the Amitriptyline liquid only lasts one month from opening, i will stay at 5mg tab for 3 or 4 weeks to allow my brain chemicals tp adjust then get another script for the liquid before i commence my final drop to 0	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

My main fear is never sleeping properly again. I've had 2 bad sleeps in a row now but they were warm, still nights and I've got a couple of itchy mosquito bites so I'm hoping that's what's been waking me up through the night. My general body pain is worse too but I had an excellent physio/massage today so that should help me sleep tonight.	4	2	3	3	1	1	0					3

I'm not sure but it could be. I think I read somewhere that it takes 2 weeks to get out of your system so when you reduce it could take a couple of weeks to feel the full effects of the withdrawal at that stage.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333

I'm awake in the middle of the night for the 3rd night in a row with two insanely itchy mosquito/midge bites on my hand. Nothing eases the itching. Antihistamine cream, ice pack, tiger balm 😨. Nothing works. My sleep is definitely not as good on 15mg as it was on 17.5mg but hopefully will be better without the itching.

Hi Fussyfussy how are you doing re ami  weaning, i have had to stay at 2.5 mg as experiencing bad dizziness and lightheadedness, belching , neck pain and acid reflux, i have no nausea. I have  anxiety now which is worring, i have been on 2.5mg for a week these symptoms are not stopping. i am thinking of just stopping the amitriptyline now what do you think? 	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

 I too am trying to come off this evil little drug, I was put on it to help with Valium withdrawal well now I have two evil little drugs to come off. I have come down to 3mg v from 30mg, but thought it would be wiser to come off the amitriptyline first as the cuts take so long to feel with me it is about 11 weeks before I feel any effects and then if I reinstate it takes too long to feel stable.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
The side effects for me are terrible anger, plus I have a weird almost like high voltage wires buzzing through my brain I have had that for over a year now it did start to subside which was great and I felt quite normal but have since made another cut so I have come from 25 mg down to 10 mg now.	5	5	3	4.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667	1.333333333					4.333333333

 Within a very short space of time (without seeing how it all crept up on me) I ended up on Valium, Olanzapine, Seraquel, Norspan patches and Tramadol.

I asked my Dr but said that it definitely wasn't from the ami so after extensive tests to rule out MS, Brain tumor or any other horrendous disease it was just a shrug of the shoulders and all put down to anxiety 	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

My body pain got so bad, I had given up smoking and thought it was that lol but after reading a few people's experience I now know it wa the ami it lasted for over 10 months before it started to subside for quite a while there I could not sit cross legged on the floor as my leg muscles were so stiff and sore it was impossible thankfully that has mostly rectified itself.

Amanda thanks for replying, re the leg pain was actually more leg stiffness and felt like you had done a massive workout where you feel really stiff after, weird I know but so glad that has gone but I definitely think it is withdrawal.

Hi Amanda and Sammy, I'm just catching up on posts now and hope that you are both doing well. I've also got an abnormal amount of general body pain and stiffness.

one funny thing was that I was in my accommodation on Naxos the other day and had a wierd feeling that the very solid house I was in was shaking and rolling. I immediately put it down to a withdrawal symptom from Ami until I found out later that we'd actually had an earthquake. So, that has shown me that I can't blame everything on Amitrytyline.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I stumbled across your post. I was on amitryptyline 50mg for 20 years. My doctor did a straight swap on to mirtazapine 12 weeks ago. The doc basically told me to cut 50 mg amitryptyline down in 5 days which I now know was a mistake. Wanted I wanted to ask you is could I still be experiencing withdrawals 12 weeks later from stopping the amitryptyline.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I'm feeling so unwell I'm trying to work out if it's from stopping the amitryptyline or its the mirtazapine doing it. Asked my doctor this same question 4 weeks ago and she said the amitryptyline will be gone. I'm not so sure she seems to think swapping one pill to another should have no ill affects. Told her I wanted off the mirtazapine so she told me her version of withdrawing. Come off it and had 4 days off hell. She didn't even know how for me to taper safely. 	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I was also prescribed amytriptyline for dyspepsia. Obviously everyones body reacts differently to medications but for me even at the lowest dose it was terrible. I took it before bed as directed, woke up after sleeping 13 hours (normally I sleep 7 or 8) and still felt like a zombie who had pulled an allnighter.

I had a spinal cord injury in my neck 12 years ago that left me with nerve damage and some weakness in my limbs . I get pins and needles from the neck down .

I've taken Amitryptiline 20mgs at night for those 12 years. Several times I've tried to stop. I don't know why, because I don't have any problems with it. Each time, I've taken it down slowly 3-4 months using a tablet cutter. By the time I get down to 10mgs,it's not long before my pins and needles are back and my ability to do anything that needs effort, my pain is bad. So I've accepted that those symptoms are there to stay and I don't try to stop anymore. It's a very old drug but it's the best drug for nerve pain.

I'd say to you, if it's helping your pain, carry on taking it. I've never had any side effects, other than a dry mouth when I was taking 50mgs. Other than that, my experience of the drug has only been positive.	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667

so i asked my dr how to wean off and he said to take half of the 25mg (12.5mg) for a week then stop. i am wondering if this is too fast? i am thinking maybe i should take half for two weeks instead then take half every other day for a week after that	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
you could certainly try what he has suggested and if you feel you are getting too many unwanted side effects, you could half the half or like you say every other day. its all trial and error unfortunately.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Personally I think it's a little quick,, I'm not a doctor,,,, think if it was me I'd try every other day first,,, then if ok half the tablet,, these are a tablet you have to be careful with coming off,slower the better,, don't rush it!	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
First ask your GP for a prescription of 10mg tablets. That way, you can reduce to 20mgs to start with. Take that dose for 2-3 weeks. Then drop down again for 2-3 weeks etc. The problem is that the tablets are very small and will be difficult to cut in half accurately, but you can try cutting one in order to drop to 15mgs. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Then down to one tablet of 10mgs, then down to 5mgs before stopping. Ask at a pharmacy if they sell tablet cutters. I don't know if they do. They cut the tablet accurately whereas cutting with a knife is not accurate.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I asked my doctor to prescribe me 10mg tablets and I will try it that way. I have already started taking half of the 25mg for two nights but I think it should be fine to start with 20mg tonight don’t you think? At least this way it will be more accurate.

are palpitations a withdrawal symptom when coming off amitryptiline? i am now on 10mg and have been having them 😕	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I know you said you had neck pain and this drug is used for nerve pain which is often the nature of neck pain. Did you also suffer from anxiety? When you stop taking it you're likely to have a return of your pain because the drug masked the pain but didn't cure the cause	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
If you also had anxieties, withdrawing the drug will allow the anxiety to return also and anxiety can often trigger palpitations as part of what is called a panic attack. If anxiety is an issue for you, that may be all it is. and, if so, then its harmless. If not, then discuss it with your GP.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
i did have anxiety but it was never to the point of panic attacks and before recently i have never had palpitations before. i am thinking/hoping it is a withdrawal symptom and that it will pass. i am going to take the 10mg for a while to get my body used to being on a lower dose. it is crazy what meds can do to you	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

yes there can be, but not everyone experiences symptoms. its recommended to taper 10% of your dose every 2-4 weeks depending on how you're feeling. www.survivingantidepressants.org can help you set up a taper plan if you feel your doctors recommendations are too fast for you. they can guide you in how to liquid taper if you need to since ami only comes in 10mg at the lowest dose.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

I was wondering if i could get some answers as to how long it took you to get over the amitriptyline withdrawl symtoms? I know the amount taken and the amount of time it was taken for plays a large role of this	3	3	0	2	1	1	2			INVALID		2	
i was on 10mg for around 4 years then 50mg for around 2 years. The VA prescribed this for sleeping. Long story short, I had to stop taking the Amitriptyline abruptly on Febuary 6th, 2019 because it caused my heart to go into V-Tach. So i have been off the drug completely for 5 months. 	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

i was on 20mgs for 5 years, i also had to stop them suddenly. it wasn't the best experience ive ever had.

the most troublesome withdrawal symptom im having is feeling so sick all of the time and the hot sweats, is it likely to stay like this for a while or does it gradually ease off each day? i know its different for every person but the thought if feeling like this for months is making me want to go back on it 😦	5	4	4	4.333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					4.333333333

Sometimes it's pre menstrual, but other times like now it's in the middle of my cycle and there is no real reason, so I was interested to read that before you actually go through menopause, there are actually surges of oestrogen that can peak to levels higher than any other time, and this saps the body's resources and limits the amount it's ability to produce other hormones - like seratonin, dopaine, adrenaline, so these all crash which is why we feel awful, so I'm trying to make sure I take vitamins and supplements and eat well ((even though I don't feel like it) which does help - though some days its so bad you just have to ride it out, and take reassurance that you're not alone x	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3

I normally get sore breasts, but not this month. Instead, I was having bouts of anxiety, crying for just no reason.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

These are pretty good indications that it’s peri menopause, my period is now down to 1-2 days, brownish in colour and I start to ovulate the day after its finishes - which definitely isn’t what it used to be!	4	5	4	4.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					4.333333333	
I’ve been to loads of doctors and there is no way of diagnosing peri menopause because it’s not an illness, but there are a lot of symptoms, I was prescribed hrt privately for a year and it worked great for 6 months and then just stopped, I think probably my hormones became so erratic it couldn’t level out any more?!	5	5	4	4.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					4.666666667	
Really hrt is only for post menopausal women who’ve not had a period for over a year, and when the hormones should have levelled out, otherwise it can just exacerbate the problems, but you should definitely investigate that if you think it might help,	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Right interesting to know you also get the dry mouth, do you get night sweats as well? Sometimes when I'm going through one of these spells, I wake in the night covered in sweat, like as if I'd been in a sauna! And it's freezing outside, so weird, and I have really vivid intense dreams...I also get the brain fog, constantly walking into rooms forgetting what I needed..causes anxiety when I go out....but then as you say it can then go after a few days, making you wonder what all the fuss was about!	4	5	4	4.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					4.333333333

I use to get bad headaches, breast pains, hot flashes, but since taking 1000mg evening primrose oil daily these symptoms have totally stopped. It's been the best meds for me. Now I have to find ways to cope with the nausea. My mum tells me to sip ginger tea, will have to try.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hi for at of you suffering with nausea, I can recommend motillium - I’ve taken it over the past couple of days and it’s helped and also gave me some appetite back, I’m in Ireland and got it from my pharmacist, who gave me 2 weeks supply, though you can get it online too, it’s just to be used with caution if you have a heart condition. I’m relived I’ve found something that can help me when the nausea gets bad, so hopefully it will help you too x	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

So much worrying, over thinking , what could it be and mostly about loss of appetite, which btw no one warns you about, quite the opposite, all websites point out one will gain weight when it all begins.	3	1	1	1.666666667	1.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667					1.666666667

I think they all fail to warn us that with anxiety from our crazy hormones our appetite is effected. Mine has been bad. Food is just not appealing to me at all right now.

Hello, I'm new to this group. I'm 49 and just today, got the official news from the dr that I've started perimenopause. Tho, ive had symptoms for a while. Now, since this past tues, my appetite has decreased, still no real enjoyment from eating. Very different for me.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I've had all sorts of symptoms - the worst at the moment is the lower back and hip pain. I feel like I've suddenly aged a 100 years. What I find difficult to cope with is that I can feel quite good one day, go to bed that night, and then feel terrible the next day. I have a horrible taste in my mouth that drives me mad, suddenly come over with the most awful fear and panic for absolute no reason and feel like my old self has just be 'stolen' from under my nose. My back muscles are so painful for doing anything and trying to tell myself that this will eventually get better is very difficult when you feel so rotten.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I lost over 40 lbs in the beginning and just knew I was dying. I.m still alive over a year later. and I have my appetite back but nothing like it was before. I still have no appetite in the mornings but by night I.m starving. My whole body is foreign to me now.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

Its all classic menopause... weird headches... muscle tention.. you will find over time you get it all over..it kind of moves around the body.

Ive had pretty much everything on there at one time or another.

Sinus issues are common with peri..	3	3	3	3	0	0	0					3

Hi Kim are you still experiencing these strange symptoms on your scalp I feel like someone has pulled my hair or I have bumped my head it just feels raw . No pain inside just on the scalp 💕	3	4	3	3.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					3.333333333	
The first year of perimenopause (I didn’t know what it was back then) I had almost daily migraines on one side of head with horrible scalp pain and tenderness. I would also get a really hot face. One of the most difficult times for me. Went on for 6 months. Only came on in afternoons. Scalp pain is a common symptom of migraine and also some types of neuralgia caused by migraine. I’m sorry you are having this! I saw a neuro and had all the tests but decided not to take the migraine meds.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I went to my doctor and my heart rate was through the roof, blood pressure was high and I was talking a mile a minute explaining how I was feeling because my anxiety was through the roof.

I'm not sure if what I take works or it settled on its own.... but I do take 400 mg of magnesium glycinate and I feel that that does help some. Also reminding myself that it's just hormones, take a deep breath and do something to occupy myself also helps. I hope you feel better 😃	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Thanks again Kim. I can't believe she asked you if you were using cocaine! If your hormones are out of whack your going to have highs and lows. That's the same for bipolar disorder but, it just seems to be the normal assumption like when this hits and the first thing your prescribed is antidepressants for depression and anxiety which is actually brought on by your hormones.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

Unless in months this doesn't clear. I may have to see if I could try it because I can't function right now at all with this anxiety. It's a year and 4 months already! I remind myself it's hormones but, it doesn't really help me when I can't fully focus and concentrate. I'm constantly reminded by that -that I can't function due to that. I hope you feel better too!

I know exactly how you feel. This is, by far, the hardest thing that I have ever had to face.

I just came off of seven days of feeling just like myself, and life was so easy. I convinced myself that it was over, but, unfortunately it isn't.

Has anyone had the feeling that they can't clear their throat properly?It feels like I have phlegm or something just sitting in the back of my throat.

I have the same problem, it's like I have a congestion in my upper respiratory, I also get a sensationof difficulty swallowing, I've seen 3doctors and I'm told it's a menopause symptoms, I get dry mouth too but my doctor says upon examination my mouth and throat is moist.

Yes, especially in the am the first few hours I'm up. its aweful. at times I feel like I'm either going to throw up or be unable to breath. ots strange.

Yes, I have the same issue. It happens in the evening and sometimes in the morning. I feel like I cannot clear my throat, like there is something stuck in my throat. I have been in peri now for about 5 years. I was also diagnosed with GERD/Gastritis many years ago, so sometimes that will flare now and I think it adds to the throat issue. I'm 49. I have been on BHRT for about a year and while that has helped immensely with a lot of other symptoms, it doesn't take care of everything. My doctor said that in peri/menopause any pre-existing/chronic condition will most definitely be worse because of the fluctuations in hormones. It's so frustrating!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I've had this off and on since I started perimenopause (~2 years ago, I am 45). I went to an ENT and was diagnosed with LPR (Silent Reflux). When it happens, I take an omeprazole (Nexium) in the morning as soon as I get up (~1 hour prior to eating) and a famotidine (Pepcid) right before bed. This combination does not work as well as Nexium in the AM and Zantac in the PM, but until the Zantac recall is resolved, I'm out of luck. I'm currently experiencing a pretty bad bout of it and it's so annoying.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Melissa last week i had a terrible night, heavy breathing, hard to swallow , tight chest, i too thought it was corona. I got up in the night and started pacing frantic, then the anxiety came on.

P eri and meno can play such mind games especially in this time with corona because the symptoms are similar. symptoms are hardest for me 10 days before my cycle and a week after i am done.

I have a question, have any of you experienced swelling in your ankles and or feet during your period? I am on day four and I haven't had a period since January. Prior to that I went a whole 100 days without a period. Leading up to this one, my stress and anxiety had hit an all time high with this virus running loose and my kids being home plus the hubby is home too working from home. Usually when he's at work and they're at school, that's my "me time". Now, I don't get any of that. But all that aside, my original question was about the swollen ankles. 😂 It's only the left leg. I think I've had this before but every time a symptom disappears and then resurfaces without warning, it feels new. Can anyone relate?	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

I have been on this bp medicine for years and it's never caused this reaction so I don't think it was the medicine. It's just that sometimes these symptoms come and go so randomly that you forget about them until they pop up again like some sick game of "peek-a-boo."	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

As for the ear, 5 yrs ago I thought it was allergies, my left ear felt really full and everything sounded like I was underwater, then the buzzing, ringing, whirring started. Went to my doc he said he couldn't find anything wrong, sent me to the ENT, he did a hearing test and I had lost all my low tone hearing, he sent me for an MRI and no bone or other issues, so that was that, he wanted to see me in a year, he repeated the hearing test.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I went from low tone loss to high tone loss and regained the low tone. He said hes never seen that happen before. The ringing has never stopped, I learned to ignore it.	1	3	3	2.333333333	1.333333333	0.6666666667	0.6666666667					2.333333333	
I can't hear much of anything out of my left ear. I just turned 52, but had a hysto 2001 and kept my ovaries. I've mentioned all these symptoms to my PCP, Cardiologist, Gynecologist and Oncologist and they all poo poo my symptoms and try to find other reasons,	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
which so far they haven't and bc of no periods I have zero clue where I'm at in this process and none of them will check my hormone levels, they say they're not accurate, but I'd love to have at least something to go by.	3	4	3	3.333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333					3.333333333	
So, in my opinion it is your hormones and my best advise is try not to stress over it as hard as that is. I suffer from an anxiety and panic disorder and on medication for it but menopause sure knows how to kick into overdrive.. Good Luck!	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Yes I'm trying to cope with my anxiety but sometimes it's very hard with the constant ringing in my ear . Sleep is hard as well because of all my symptoms . I am now looking into different anxiety coping mechanism.	4	5	5	4.666666667	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					4.666666667	
For months I stuffed a cotton ball in my ear and for whatever reason that helped me. It also drains almost constantly. For my anxiety, which I've dealt with for over 30 yrs, I make myself busy, cleaning, playing a game, reading etc.	4	5	5	4.666666667	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					4.666666667	
Its tough bc mine manifests into extreme nausea, hot flashes (these are worse than meno hot flashes) visible tremors, dizziness, ocular migraines, shortness of breath and chest pains.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
As I mentioned I already have heart problems so of course waking up with what I know is meno palpitations and will subside after I get moving it kicks the anxiety into overdrive, it's a viscous cycle. I take paxil and xanax but it's not a cure, it helps though.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
A few things that help naturally with anxiety is grounding yourself, use your senses, 5 things you can see, touch, and hear. Deep even breaths, in thru your nose out thru your mouth. Also, what a lot of ppl don't know is caffeine, chocolate and red meat is not good for anxiety, cut back on those if you eat them.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I also find counting silly things helps. I was never good at meditation lol my brain is all over the place and never shuts up which is why I try to do activities. For sleep and ringing ear try using white noise, like a fan, it's amazing that the whirring of the fan helps block it out. I sleep on my bad ear side since I cant hear out of it except the ringing. I hope that some of these suggestions help and it eases your anxiety.. hang in there!	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667

I turned 50 a few months ago and this isn't what I thought 50 would be. But I just wanted to share last year my spouse started to have a 'clogged' ear along with some headaches. He went to many doctors and ENT-- had a CT scan, MRI and a couple other tests. Nothing came up except some strange thing about the bone in the ear maybe.	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1

Hi Ladies, I'm so traumatized by what happened to me through peri with the anxiety and panic attacks and literally feeling like I was at deaths door.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I'm literally afraid to move in any direction now. I'm on a med and it is helping with anxiety but, I'm still struggling with anxiety /peri fatigue and I'm pushing each day but, it's been over a year now heading into a year and 4 months.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I can't snap out of this. I'm still in like a trance that won't break. I'm trying to move forward but, the fatigue is hurting me mentally in order to be able to comprehend all that is happening around me. I'm so tired of this. Bad day today. Wanting to live again normal. I had depression with this. I don't know if I should sleep more or stay up more at night. I don't have sleep issues but, I don't know if less sleep or more sleep will help me wake up from this.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

NothinforNothin that was me when this first started a yr and a half ago. Scared, traumatized out of my mind to the point where i went no where. I was scared of panic attacks and the gut awful feeling of falling over when i walked.	5	4	3	4	1	0	1					4	
I recall one day in the grocery store and i had a panic attack and sat on the floor and a lady came over to hold my hand. Also a time when i was driving and had to pull over. It was a complete living nightmare for me.	5	4	4	4.333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					4.333333333

Every time i had a symptom i would run to my journal and tell myself that it is just hormones and that i made it through the last one, i would make it through this one. I must say that the panic attacks have slowed down a lot since then but when i do get them i try to calm down.	5	4	3	4	1	0	1					4

This is something a lot of Americans don't understand. Most other nations negotiate the price of drugs and medical supplies from the drug and medical manufacturers ahead of time.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0

So the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, etc. ask for the best bulk price they can get from the drug manufacturers at the beginning of the budget year.

Whole countries have taken to banding together to make sure that they get the best possible price from the drug and medical supplies manufacturers. And in the US, it's currently illegal for the US government to even think about doing this.

I experience these. I have a long history of headaches and migraines, but my first ocular/headache with aura was around age 30. I had just finished playing racquetball and got the aura while driving home. I was scared that I was having a stroke, laid down when I got home & the headache came.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I've since learned to take pain medication at the first onset of the aura (which usually lasts around 20-30 mins) & I can catch the headache from turning into a bad one/migraine. I can get them while looking at computer screen, reading a book in sunshine, or just about anytime, but often there's a light issue that will prompt it (likely the white walls of the racquet court).	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I'm now 49, so this style of migraine has been a part of my life now for nearly 20 years. Since I've experienced hormone changes, I have noticed similar mini episodes of the aura without the full on headache - more the visual aura issues in little spurts.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I believe these are hormone related issues, even though it feels neurological. As always, best to get professional advice about your personal symptoms, but I suspect you can count this as a peri-menopausal issue.	1	0	0	0.3333333333	0.6666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333					0.3333333333	
My auras make it difficult to see when they're happening, and then it's like a wiggly watery mirage that grows larger until it moves to the outer edge of my eyesight.

Ugh, 1-2 a week is rough...I suspect this will subside in time, perhaps to come back at a later date, but hopefully it will ease off for good.

I've been finding that certain nasty or weird symptoms have a way of popping up again after going away for a few months or even a year or more. I've been at this for the past 9, almost 10 years so I feel like symptoms rotate and next go around I'm not as scared of them (though I'm going through a bad spell again right now & do get spooked still).	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667	
I feel like I recognize your name and think you've been on here a long time, like myself, or else we've had some similar symptoms in the past & I've read your posts & thought, "oh thank goodness someone else knows what I'm experiencing!" I'm trying to think of what triggers you can maybe avoid, other than the obvious bright lights, screens, bright sunshine reflecting off stuff...perhaps staying well hydrated, trying to get decent hours of sleep, avoiding salt/sugar etc., and making sure you're eating fairly regularly.	4	4	3	3.666666667	0.3333333333	0.3333333333	0.6666666667					3.666666667

You poor thing!! I was like this for years.Nothing touched it at all!! Same pattern.I was on citalapram also (still am) 20mg for two days then 10mg .I wasn't reducing at that time but still had the bad heads and migraine.Iam surgical meno now.When I saw my gynae before hysterectomy and I explained what I was like(same as you) he said I shouldn't have suffered and should have gone to see him.i got the impression a low hormone treatment he would have given me. Getting past the Drs who were only willing to dish out  naproxen ,cocodamol , to help with any inflammation was hard.Huge fibroid got the ball rolling to see the consultant.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

It ruins your life , time off work .etc.. plus u feel naff for days after like you have flu. may be the very low dose may not be helping as there will be side effects of nausea, dizziness & visual disturbances. 5mg is low.If you are working through it with the gp I would mention it all.I suppose it's a bit difficult which is causing what effect.

Hi Jane... So sorry you feel awful. I have suffered with migraines since I was about 10. I am 52 now. They have varied over the years.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I would get if I didnt eat or slept too much or different smells, like diesel fumes or some perfumes. I noticed they would get bad just before my period. I would have the same symptoms you are experiencing-vision auras, nauseous to the point of not being able to move and pounding pounding pain in my head.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4	
There are various causes of migraines: Eating foods high in nitrates, cheeses, chocolate, high sodium foods or snacks. Noxious fumes, perfumes, wearing hair ties or clips, muscle tension or jaw clenching, eye strain, changes in altitude and definitely hormones. I have read that a quick drop in hormone levels can bring on a migraine and this is what occurs when we menstruate. I do know that you have to take something for it as soon as you get a symptom of a migraine.  If not, it gets excruciating, nausia, sensitive to light and sound and movement.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
Keeping a log of when your migraines occur, what you are doing or eating and where they occur could help pinpoint triggers. I hope you find this helpful. Feel better ☯️	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0	
I agree with Lisa about triggers. I am 58 in postmenopause and have had migraines since I was 16. I take 300 mg. of topamax a day to help me keep them calm. But, the weather pressure, stress, etc. triggers them.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Yes..   I get this headaches and it was around my period.   It seems like I get them for months then it stops for awhile.  When I did have them I would take sinus meds cuz I didn't know if it was a sinus headache or not.  They would last for about 2 days.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Hi Jane, I have also suffered from migraines from hormones and now I also get them from trapped nerves in my neck. Probably 5 year ago I finally found a doctor who actually believed I was having migraines and prescribed maxalt wafers and they've saved my life.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
They take an hour to work and get rid of the pain and the nausea. Two weeks ago I had a run of migraines for 8 days and only missed one off work due to the maxalt. They can make me tired but I'll take that any day over a migraine. Rosemary.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I am just coming up to a year with no periods, which I can't say I miss one bit. I'm now having very dry skin generally, but particularly on my face.

It looks pretty unsightly, like I've been sunburned, and obviously I am trying to sleep on my back but that's not going very well.

I might suggest switching to laundry detergent and fabric softener for sensitive skin and see if that works for the rash. I rinse all my sheets and laundry twice so I am not having that issue.

hello! my name is malina and my problems started a year ago with a weird, all of a sudden shoulder pain. since then i developed all kind of weird symptoms: muscle pain, bone pain, joints pain, mostly on my upper left of my body. i had also jaw and ear pain for a while, but not any more. the pain is daily for almost a year and sometimes unbearable in my shoulder, arm, elbow and my finders. two months ago I started to have a problem with my right foot, my heel and my toes. the pain comes and goes.	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

Blood tests normal as I have tested positive years ago for RA. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. With the help of a naturopath, I doubled my daily intake of magnesium, started on CoQ10, take a daily CBD oil (manufactured so over the counter).

I have diagnosed and managed ADHD, as well as a degree in a field that makes me rather knowledgeable about noticing it in others. I am also super vocal about having it for a couple reasons. Mainly, if I tell people "I'm like this because of the way my brain works, please tell me to shut the fuck up if you need to" then I'm easier to deal with.

Sorry for my late response, I must have missed it.  I ended up getting a stomach infection after my iron infusion also. That's why it took so long for me to heal.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
It was helicobacter pylori and it was hell. I was on antibiotics for 2 weeks to kill it off and finished them mid May. It took me up to early May to come back to work on reduced hours.  I am still feeling the effects of the stomach infection and not yet 100%.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
My specialist said that iron is such a strong mineral, it ended up washing away my whole stomach flora enabling the bad bacteria to thrive.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Knowing what I know now, never again. I still have to manage my diet and avoid highly acidic foods, red meat being one of them but once my stomach inflammation heals I will increase my iron rich foods in my diet and have regular blood tests to monitor. I hope you are feeling better?	4	4	4	4	0	0	0					4

No diarrhea anymore, but the nausea comes in terrible waves, exhaustion, fever. I can barely work a few hours a day. I’m on day 22 since infusion. How did they test for H. Pylori? Did you feel better once you started it?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
When I was in hospital they did a colonoscopy and gastroscopy and found the bacteria in my biopsies. Everything else was all clear but the iron did make me very sick.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Due to the bacteria I wasn't able to each much which meant my diarrhoea subsided but that's what put me in hospital initially, excessive diarrhoea due to the the iron infusion. My stomach feels better after having completed the AB to kill off the bacteria but I am still experiencing feelings of off balance/dizziness. I initially started feeling like this when I commenced on the AB for the bacteria and now it's just continued.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Seeing a second Dr on the weekend given my regular GP didn't have a clue.  I know it's not iron given my last blood test was over 6 weeks ago and iron levels high/good.  My specialist said it will take at least 6 months for my iron to settle.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I still have bouts of nausea but I don't think it is from the iron infusion but from my spells of off balance/dizziness and I'm yet to find a Dr who can tell me what is causing it. My naturopath suspects it is still my inflamed stomach which takes a minimum of 6 weeks to heal.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
The antibiotics themselves caused dizziness/nausea (one of the many side effects listed in the leaflet) and only helped with everything but these symptoms. I did take a strong probiotic that my Naturopath recommended and I finished that last week, took it for a whole 30 days during and after my AB treatment.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
I didn't throw up but felt very close to doing so with the nausea and in the height of my stomach issues, wasn't able to eat a thing. It was only when my Dr placed me on Nexium to help with the stomach acid that it settled and I was able to eat very bland foods.  My diet has improved since I finished he AB though but I am still avoiding highly acidic foods until I can be certain my stomach inflammation is gone.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

It wasn't until I asked for my own private Dr (I have private health cover) that he pieced it all together.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
He said, he suspected that given iron is a such a strong mineral and a lot of people experience gastro intestinal problems when taking any sort of iron supplement, that the infusion I was given was too much for me in one go, that it completely flushed out my gut flora and enabled the bad bacteria to thrive, hence causing my stomach infection.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5	
Agree it is not normal, I had all the symptoms you describe above directly after my iron infusion also.  We are the rare group who have severe reactions to the iron and unfortunately Dr's do not tell you this or monitor you afterwards to help you get back to normal.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

I also had two sessions over two weeks and thought wow not much in side effects as if there are side effects to be had I get them and I don't think my doctor always believes me. One week after the second infusion it started and I thought I had a tummy bug so isolated myself as I live in a retirement apartment and spend lots of time in the communal lounge and did not want to pass it on - it then seemed to clear up but a few days later it came back with stomach problems, nausea, headache and woozy, a very dry mouth and so very tired.	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

Can anyone out there give a clue as to how long all this will last, I only had the infusion as when the doctor phoned to say my iron was still low and to increase the iron tablets I was prescribed and I said I did not like being on them that she suggested the infusion so now do not know which way to go though having had the infusion it is too late to do anything until it wears off so how long will that be?	5	5	5	5	0	0	0					5

We dug deep deep to find the real cause of the pain. It was a life changing experience for both of us. I have posted many inspired poems on Messages From Baird FB page and Sunrise Reiki as well. Thank you and God Bless all of you.	1	2	0	1	0	1	1					1

Your ankle bone and the ends of your two lower leg bones make up the ankle joint. Your ligaments, which connect bones to one another, stabilize and support it. Your muscles and tendons move it.	0	0			0								
The most common ankle problems are sprains and fractures (broken bones). A sprain is an injury to the ligaments. It may take a few weeks to many months to heal completely. A fracture is a break in a bone. You can also injure other parts of the ankle such as tendons, which join muscles to bone, and cartilage, which cushions your joints. Ankle sprains and fractures are common sports injuries.	0	0

The prime minister has had oxygen support today. He has been moved to intensive care in case he needs to be on a ventilator. As for @DominicRaab , he won’t be called temporary PM, but that is what he will be, to all intents and purposes.	0

Can anyone help me with this? I have had a slight allergic reaction to hair dye shampoo recently on the cheek, chin and eyebrow area, which I have identified by reducing contact with the shampoo and my skin. However I believe it has also caused a reaction to my lips.	5												
For almost two weeks now, my lips have been chapped, irritated and dry. I am applying lip balm every half hour and haven't seen any improvement aside from short term relief.	4												
I read a suggestion online to try using Hydrocortisone on the lips each night during sleep, but I can't say this has helped either.	5												
I'm running out of options	0												
I would increase your fluid intake and change your lip balm you may have an allergy to it.	0												
have you tried antihistamines and E45 lip balm? Also take a multi vitamin and mineral tablet every day	0												
I get dermatitis and find when I forget my vitamins I get a flare up. omega 3 oil tablets are good too.	5												
my answer is being moderated at the moment because I mentioned a brand name that is advertised on this site. I recommended antihistamine tablets and a lip balm from the makers of a very famous cream which is the letter E and the number in between 40 and 50!	0												
Also a multivitamin and mineral tablet every day and omega3 tablets.	0												
My allergist told me many years ago to never use any products from that particular brand as the number of chemicals therein is excessive. My advice would also be to change lip balm and increase your water intake.	5												
I've tried a natural lip gloss that has great reviews online. I suffer from dry lips and have reactions to a lot of other brands because of the ingredients. It doesn't have any chemicals and I read a review from a woman who was on anti biotics which dried out her lips said it fixed her lips in under two days. They're an aussie indie company called Halo is the New Black lip gloss. I hope this helps.	3
